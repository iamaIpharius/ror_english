 afghanistan.1.t:0 "Execution of Treaty.
 afghanistan.1.desc:0 "The attempt to declare war bypassing the king and the British mission failed. Parts loyal to the king and pro-British forces reacted in time. The treaty gives Britain control of our foreign policy and army."
 afghanistan.1.a:0 "Fairy idiots..."
 afghanistan.2.t:0 "Enforcement of treaty with Afghanistan."
 afghanistan.2.desc:0 "A few days ago, Afghan radicals tried to pit the Muslim population against us and revolt against British influence in their country. But it seems that the Khan was not involved or even aware of this plan. Now control of this mountainous region has been restored. For how long...?"
 afghanistan.2.a:0 "It could have been worse."
 afghanistan.3.t:0 "Hunting incident."
 afghanistan.3.desc:0 "Horror! Habibulah Khan is found dead in his tent while hunting. All indications are that the khan was murdered, but the culprit could not be found. The soldiers who had accompanied him were not found with him, and most likely either fled or were involved in the murder. Who benefited from the Shah's death? This is a difficult question to answer, but one way or another, we will be mourning our dear Shah, a Freemason and just a good expense item in the English budget."
 afghanistan.3.a:0 "Memento mori."
 afghanistan.4.t:0 "Inter-tribal discord."
 afghanistan.4.desc:0 "The bad news is that there has been a fight between two tribes in an area of our country. Each of the tribes believes that members of the hostile tribe have entered someone else's territory while grazing their sheep. The matter must be resolved."
 afghanistan.4.a:0 "Take the side of one of the tribes."
 afghanistan.4.b:0 "Investigate."
 afghanistan.4.c:0 "Let the Imams decide."
 afghanistan.4.e:0 "The solution is in the Shariah."
 afghanistan.5.t:0 "Disputes among the elders."
 afghanistan.5.desc:0 "Today there was a conflict between two influential members of Afghanistan's clans right in Kabul Square. Apparently, the discussion, which slowly turned into a scuffle, began over some unique European product. One way or another, we have to decide what to do about this situation after all."
 afghanistan.5.a:0 "Take the side of one of the elders."
 afghanistan.5.b:0 "Assign the goods to yourself."
 afghanistan.5.c:0 "Let the Imams decide."
 afghanistan.5.e:0 "The solution is in the Shariah."
 afghanistan.6.t:0 "What is it, Barrymore?"
 afghanistan.6.desc:0 "Terrible news. It seems that some common Pashtun has insulted a British consular representative from a noble and, more sadly, influential family and is demanding compensation in the form of execution of a commoner. Something must be done..."
 afghanistan.6.a:0 "Execute the commoners."
 afghanistan.6.b:0 "Try to pay them off."
 afghanistan.6.c:0 "Let the Imams sort it out."
 afghanistan.6.e:0 "The solution is in the Shariah."
 afghanistan.7.t:0 "Haram."
 afghanistan.7.desc:0 "Scandal, scandal! One of your relatives was seen having an extramarital intimate relationship with a member of another respectable Afghan family! The enraged relatives of the "spoiled" already demand the head of your excessively promiscuous family member. What shall we do?"
 afghanistan.7.a:0 "Let them take it."
 afghanistan.7.b:0 "Try to pay them off."
 afghanistan.7.c:0 "Have a trial."
 afghanistan.7.e:0 "The solution is in Shariah."
 afghanistan.9.t:0 "Dear nephew..."
 afghanistan.9.desc:0 "Nasrullah Khan is the brother of Habibullah Khan and, in general, should not have become shah. However, fearing for his power, Habibullah Khan has been pampering his brother in every way possible: giving him a large share of British subsidies, appointing him commander-in-chief of the army, and even declaring him heir!Nasrullah Khan enjoys the support of the generals and religious circles, but recently the Young Afghans have become stronger, and Amanullah, Habibullah Khan's son, has fallen under their influence. Should we pre-emptively arrest him?"
 afghanistan.9.a:0 "Send a detachment of soldiers after him immediately."
 afghanistan.9.b:0 "Nothing to worry about."
 afghanistan.10.t:0 "Coup Amanullah."
 afghanistan.10.desc:0 "As soon as Amanullah learned of his father's death, he quickly lured the Kabul garrison to his side and declared himself the new emir, after which he stripped all positions and ranks of his uncle and his brothers, while ordering their arrests. "
 afghanistan.10.a:0 "Let's hope they don't resist..."
 afghanistan.11.t:0 "Declaration of Independence!"
 afghanistan.11.desc:0 "After arresting all potential opponents, Amanullah Khan has concentrated all power in his hands. The time had finally come to declare independence from the British! The tribes have already sent out their warriors, and our friends behind that nasty 'Durand Line' have started an uprising..."
 afghanistan.11.a:0 "Freedom or death!"
 afghanistan.12.t:0 "Gathering of the Tribes."
 afghanistan.12.desc:0 "Alas, but capturing Nasrullah failed. He declared Amanullah a usurper and used his influence to revolt. The tribes loyal to us have already raised their soldiers, but can we win...?"
 afghanistan.12.a:0 "We must."
 afghanistan.13.t:0 "Freedom!"
 afghanistan.13.desc:0 "We managed to defend our independence! The conflict has lasted three months and the British government doesn't seem to be interested in continuing it."
 afghanistan.13.a:0 "Allah!"
 afghanistan.14.t:0 "Victory?"
 afghanistan.14.desc:0 "We managed to take control of the Indian provinces with a Pashtun majority. This is already a huge success, perhaps we should start negotiations for peace?"
 afghanistan.14.a:0 "Of course."
 afghanistan.14.b:0 "What about trying to revive the Durrani Empire?"
 afghanistan.15.t:0 "A revived Empire!"
 afghanistan.15.desc:0 "A miracle has happened! We have won! Our sovereign now controls vast territories with Muslim and Pashtun populations. Allah Himself favors our Emir! The time has come to announce the rebirth of Durrani state! And perhaps this should be the end of the war. We have achieved our goals - and more."
 afghanistan.15.a:0 "Allah!"
 afghanistan.16.t:0 "Liberation is coming!"
 afghanistan.16.desc:0 "Having finally established power within the country, it is time to finally declare independence from Great Britain and denounce all the shameful treaties by which she has bound us!"
 afghanistan.16.a:0 "Freedom or death!"
 afghanistan.17.t:0 "Surrender to Afghanistan."
 afghanistan.17.desc:0 "Our armies were defeated and pushed back beyond the Indus. Afghan tribes suddenly showed a high level of fighting ability and there is clearly a German trace. Everywhere the Muslim population assisted the advancing and no longer obeyed the local administration. The Hindus, defenseless before the new threat, have also lost their fear of the central government. We are forced to recognize all the conquests of Kabul and accept the creation of a new Islamic empire, in order not to lose the remnants of power in India. "
 afghanistan.17.a:0 "From now on, everything hangs in the balance."
 afghanistan.18.t:0 "Defeat in the Anglo-Afghan War."
 afghanistan.18.desc:0 "Our armies were defeated and pushed back beyond the Indus. The Afghan tribes suddenly showed a high level of fighting ability and there is clearly a German trace. Everywhere the Muslim population assisted the advancing and no longer obeyed the local administration. The Hindus, who were defenseless against this new threat, also lost their fear of the central government. The Indian command decided to accept immediate peace and concentrate on suppressing domestic disturbances. After a defeat from outside, we risk an Indian revolution on top of that. "
 afghanistan.18.a:0 "The sun is setting over the empire..."
 afghanistan.19.t:0 "Tribal Desertion."
 afghanistan.19.desc:0 "When we started the war against the British and their minions, many tribes across the border supported us. But now that the war has dragged on and their home areas have been liberated, more and more warriors are deserting from the front. Urgent action must be taken."
 afghanistan.19.a:0 "They cannot be stopped."
 afghanistan.19.b:0 "When we take Delhi, you can loot for three days!"
 afghanistan.19.c:0 "Catch the fugitives and stone them in public!"
 afghanistan.20.t:0 "Defeat the Anglo-Afghan War."
 afghanistan.20.desc:0 "The Afghan army was utterly defeated, the emir killed by conspirators. In his place the British installed a more favorable representative of the dynasty and reinstated the old treaty."
 afghanistan.20.a:0 "It was unwise to oppose our lords."

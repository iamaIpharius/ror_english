He has established contacts with the Cossack leadership of Orenburg, Kuban, Astrakhan and Terek and is trying to establish contact with the Ukrainian Central Rada. \nThe military government liquidated the Makeevka Soviet, a number of mine Soviets, arrests of all delegates, as well as those who returned from the [num_of_allrussian_congress_of_soviets] of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets. \nKaledin issued an order to introduce martial law throughout the Don region.

Restoration of the rights of a citizen: all Russian citizens are equal before the law, without distinction of gender or nationality; the destruction of class privileges, the preservation of the inviolability of the person and home, freedom of movement, residence, etc. \n2. Restoration in full freedom of speech and press. \n3. Restoration of freedom of industry and trade, abolition of the nationalization of private financial enterprises. \n4. Restoration of ownership. \n5. Restoration of the Russian army on the basis of genuine military discipline. The army must be formed on a voluntary basis (on the principle of the British army), without committees, commissars and elected positions. \n6. Full fulfillment of all allied obligations of international treaties accepted by Russia. The war must be carried through to the end in close unity with our allies.Peace must be concluded universal and honorable, on democratic principles, that is, with the right to self-determination of enslaved peoples. \n7. Russia introduces universal compulsory primary education with broad local school autonomy. \n8. The Constituent Assembly, disrupted by the Bolsheviks, must be convened again. Elections to the Constituent Assembly must be held freely, without pressure on the people's will and throughout the country.The personality of people's representatives is sacred and inviolable. \n9. The government created under the program of Gen. Kornilov, is responsible in his actions only to the Constituent Assembly, to which it will transfer all the fullness of state-legislative power. The Constituent Assembly, as the sole owner of the Russian land, must work out the basic laws of the Russian constitution and finally construct the state system. \n10. The Church must be given complete autonomy in matters of religion. State guardianship over matters of religion is eliminated. Freedom of religion is fully exercised. \n11. The complex agrarian question is submitted for resolution to the Constituent Assembly. Until the latter develops the final form of the land issue and the issuance of relevant laws, any kind of anarchist-grabbing actions of citizens are recognized as unacceptable. \n12. All citizens are equal before the courts. The death penalty remains in force, but is applied only in cases of the gravest state crimes. \n13. The workers retain all the political and economic gains of the revolution in the field of labor regulation, freedom of workers' unions, meetings and strikes, with the exception of the forced nationalization of enterprises and workers' control, leading to the death of domestic industry. \n14. General Kornilov recognizes for the individual nationalities that are part of Russia the right to broad local autonomy, provided, however, that state unity is preserved.Poland, Ukraine and Finland, formed into separate national-state units, should be widely supported by the Russian government in their aspirations for state revival, in order to further solder the eternal and indestructible union of fraternal peoples."

 rcw_g.11.d:0 "The first revolution was anti-landowners, the second anti-bourgeois, and now, finally, Russia is ripe for the third anti-government, the one that will demolish the remnants of the old dictatorships of parasites. And this last revolution was started by the working peasants who, after the war, will become the main class of society. \nHowever, an ideological inspirer and a military leader is now needed.

Today they can allow to take the land, but tomorrow they will certainly begin to take all the harvest from it. \nMany rebel units have connections with the white underground and officers are of great help in the correct conduct of hostilities.

Deserters, proletarians who fled from the cities and peasants embittered by extortions put together their detachments and leave for an area inaccessible to troops in order to terrorize the authorities and communication lines with raids. Despite all destructiveness, such activities are gaining more and more approval from citizens dissatisfied with our regime, and the bandits themselves sometimes show excessively good knowledge of political issues. If decisive measures are not taken, unrest in the countryside can develop into serious clashes. "

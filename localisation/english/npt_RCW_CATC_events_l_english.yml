 rcw_catc.100.desc:0 "After the defeat of our opponents in Turkestan, this region is still a hotbed of instability. Local peoples are culturally far from the Russians, under the influence of revolutionary nationalist and pan-Turkic teachings, they are even more hostile to them than before. To include such a huge region directly into our state can be dangerous and extremely costly. Perhaps it is worth creating a puppet government from local people who are ready to cooperate with us, or establish the regime of the Governorate-General."

Throughout the territory of the Transcaspian region, the power of the rebels has already been established, concentrated in the hands of the strike committees. Socialist-Revolutionary Kurilev, Socialist-Revolutionary Zimin became a friend of the Prime Minister, and became Commissar for Internal Affairs, and Dohov, a travel engineer, for Foreign Affairs.

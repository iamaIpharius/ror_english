 rcw_nva.1.desc:0 "Citizens, the Bolshevik power in [Root.Capital.GetName] has been overthrown. Those who a few months ago seized power by deception and then held it in their hands by unheard-of violence and mockery over the healthy will of the people, those who led the people to hunger and unemployment, restored brother upon brother, divided the people's treasury into pockets - now sit in prison and await retribution.The people who overthrew this power have as their aim to establish forms of broad state law, the National Assembly, legally and normally elected, must establish the foundations of the state system, establish political All obstacles to trade and movement will be removed and private trading capital will be involved in the business of supplying the population with food.The long war and the rule of the hooligans have exhausted the people's wealth, but even now we still have plenty of bread both along the Volga and in Siberia. To get this bread, to defeat hunger, we need only order, tranquility and labor discipline.The new government will firmly demand the unconditional execution of all its orders and will mercilessly prosecute all violators of the correct course of work in all institutions and enterprises.What happened in [Root.Capital.GetName] happened the same day and hour throughout the Volga.We act together with the Siberian and Samara governments and are subject to a common commander in chief, the old General Alexeyev. The Northern Army is commanded by the old revolutionary Boris Savinkov. Moscow is now surrounded by a tight ring. A little more effort - and the traitors, who have settled in the Kremlin, ruining the country and starving the people, will be swept from the face of the Russian land. All who are able to bear arms, let them join the volunteer army. As three hundred years ago our ancestors in the high patriotic enthusiasm managed to heal the wounds of the torn homeland, so we in a friendly burst will now save our homeland and our people from disgrace, slavery and hunger."

 rcw_nva.2.t:0 "Support the church."
 rcw_nva.2.desc:0 "Not much time has passed since the Bolsheviks seized power, and the Orthodox people have already suffered great damage, and it is increasing every day, with every hour of anti-Christian rule - persecution of the church, brutal killings of defenseless priests and looting of churches, expulsion of the Christian faith from everywhere. Not surprisingly, our power to expel the damned demons was received with open arms by Orthodox pastors, giving us the support of this important segment of society. Now we need to define more precisely our cooperation with spiritual authority by resolving a number of important issues in this stratum."
 rcw_nva.2.a:0 "God bless!"
 
 rcw_nva.3.t:0 "The Politics of Mobilization."
 rcw_nva.3.desc:0 "Mobilization is an unavoidable process for building an army, so our headquarters has developed two options for conducting it. The first involves compulsory conscription for officers and voluntary conscription for the rest of the population, especially the peasants. The second - compulsory conscription for all, within certain limits. Both variants have both their disadvantages and advantages - voluntary draft, even if the outcome is most favorable, we can't put many people in the ranks, but we will gain trust of the masses. By carrying out a broad mobilization we will definitely alienate a part of the population."

 rcw_nva.4.t:0 "Army Organization"
 rcw_nva.4.desc:0 "We managed to create some kind of armed forces and conduct mobilization, but the organization of the army is a mess - not even units are clearly divided into platoons, companies, etc., not to mention the smaller things like uniform identification and insignia and the attitude to shoulder straps with the old awards. It is necessary to adopt a plan as soon as possible, in the course of which the shape of our army will be clearly formed. There are two options: either we can try to move towards the so-called 'People's' Army, of course, without breeding kerenshchina, but with a softer and more controllable structure than under the tsar; or we can try not to repeat others' mistakes and organize our army with a glance at the Volunteer Army, even if it has its own flavor."

 rcw_nva.5.desc:0 "We have no internal disagreement about the ownership of arable land - it should be owned by the one who works it - the peasant. Nevertheless, another problem has arisen - whether to allow free trade in grain or to introduce regulation. On the one hand, free bread would definitely put the peasants on our side, for the prohibition of such is one of the most important reasons of dissatisfaction of the population with the Soviet rule. On the other hand, we do not have a single 'bread' province under our control, so temporary regulation will help to halt the development of the almost inevitable food crisis."
 rcw_nva.5.a:0 "Bread - free circulation."
 rcw_nva.5.b:0 "It is worth introducing regulation."
 
 rcw_nva.7.t:0 "Whistleblowers' work"
 rcw_nva.7.desc:0 "Propaganda is a thing greatly underestimated in Tsarist Russia, as in revolutionary Russia. For it is not only posters and similar propaganda material, it is first of all the communication of one's position to the broadest possible masses, the constant explanation of what and why we are fighting for and why our enemies are evil. Only the Bolsheviks appreciated this power and are actively using it to strengthen their position. If we want to win, we need to counter their agitation machine with our own."

 rcw_nva.9.t:0 "Organization of peasant uprisings"

 rcw_nva.11.t:0 "Our position."
 rcw_nva.11.desc:0 "At last our troops have met Volunteer Army units from the south. This raises the question of the necessity of the existence of our government, for we originally proclaimed ourselves the northern part of the Dobro-Army and the general supreme commander for us was General Alexeyev. On the other hand, [Root.GetLeader] wants to put himself at the forefront of the White movement, and for all the time since the uprising we have established our own authorities and army, and our political activities have differences with those of the Whites from the south."

He offers to document the preliminary agreements made by Fortunatov, creating a united front for the victory over Bolshevism.

 rcw_nva.21.t:0 "Former Commander-in-Chief."
 rcw_nva.21.desc:0 "In Moscow under our control we were able to mobilize quite a few officers for our army without unnecessary delay, but there is an individual whose fate must be considered separately - Alexei Brusilov. He was an old army general, thanks to whom perhaps the greatest victory of the Russian arms during the Second World War was made, the Lutsk breakthrough, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief under the Provisional Government in May-July 1917, a man in whose excellent military talents it is difficult to doubt. But at the same time he was remarkably mild toward all sorts of committees and Soviets that ruined the army in 1917, unlike many military leaders, and he did not join the White movement at the Don, where many patriotic officers had gathered. We must decide whether to alarm Brusilov and try to persuade him to join the ranks of our armed forces, which clearly lack an experienced high command, or to leave the suspicious general alone."
 rcw_nva.21.a:0 "Such cadres are not to be scattered!"
 rcw_nva.21.b:0 "Let him live like an ordinary citizen."
 
 rcw_nva.22.t:0 "Cooperation with Moscow organizations"
 rcw_nva.22.desc:0 "In order to realize our pretensions to all-Russian power, to strengthen the administrative apparatus and the general situation, we have to, one way or another, closely cooperate with other anti-Bolshevik parties and organizations, of which there are several in Moscow, besides the half-decayed Right Center, with which the Soviet of Public Figures and the Union of Landowners are connected, which at present have a German orientation and are therefore useless for us in the current situation. Of those with which it makes sense to cooperate, two formations are of interest - the Union of Revival (Left Center), which includes all socialist parties (Enes, Essers, Mensheviks, Unity) and leftist Cadets and also the National Center, which includes all right-wing parties and organizations (including leftist K-d), except the extreme right and pro-German ones. We can either resort to preferential cooperation with one of the associations, or we can try to continue to carry out the "sacred mission" of uniting both the right and the left, although if we gain real power, we should certainly expect conflicts from them."

If an agreement is reached with the Moscow centers, this process will only accelerate, which threatens the future disintegration of the organization as such. It is possible that if Boris Savinkov or a figure of his level were here, he might be able to place the Union in a new orbit, but alas, there is no second personality with the same kind of energy and authority in the organization.

When they came to power, the situation changed - and although the original ideals and goals of the organization remained the same, there was a noticeable drift of the Union toward uniting primarily the military, among whom moderate monarchists, often undecideds, predominated.

There are two options for their inclusion: the first implies the integration of a large number of ready-to-work figures at once with a certain inner-party autonomy, which, on the one hand will reduce the unity of the party, on the other - with a strong central line will increase its authority and allow to achieve real inner-party democracy, but at the same time will lead to a de facto monopolization of the position in the political field.

Savinkov is certainly a socialist, as are many of his comrades-in-arms, but he is not bound by the dogmas of old currents and is capable, as recent practice has shown, of uniting a wide range of patriots, from moderate monarchists to social democrats for the sake of fighting for a just cause. Real events have shown the possibility and even the necessity of fusing disparate ideologies into something new, having elements of both socialist and right-wing and even liberal doctrines, all of which are workable, and all that remains is to provide a theoretical basis and to finalize it. However, the rapid transformation of the supra-party SPR&S into a party will definitely alienate quite a few people from it, which could be dangerous in conditions of the ongoing war for survival, so perhaps we should not rush the political construction and transform the Defense Union, the good thing is that with some refinement it is still quite capable of handling the necessary load, although it will cause an increase in internal disagreements."

But with the end of the World War and the foundation of the independent state of the Czechs and Slovaks, the meaning of the further struggle against the Germans and their proxies in Russia was completely lost to them. With each passing day after receiving this news, the fighting spirit of the Slav brothers was dying out, they tried not to appear on the front lines anymore, the decay was growing, and their commanders were directly talking about the need to send the troops back to their homeland. Our leadership is ready to allow the entire corps to leave, except for those officers and soldiers who want to stay and fight on, but there is a question of disarming, though not completely, such a formidable force, which has much needed arms in its depots, but keeping in mind the causes of the uprising of the corps, it might be better not to touch the Czechoslovaks too much.

 rcw_nva.85.b:0 "Withdraw only after surrendering most weapons."
 
 rcw_nva.86.t:0 "Insubordination"
 rcw_nva.86.desc:0 "The Czechoslovaks rejoiced at the imminent withdrawal outside burning Russia, but the demand to surrender most of the weapons thwarted all joy and aroused numerous suspicions; the wildest rumors crept among the soldiers, including even the surrender of disarmed units to the Red Magyar and German internationalists.  As a result there were numerous conflicts, including those connected with the brazen hijacking of rolling stock by the Czechs. And although we managed to prevent the most dangerous variants of events and to get at least part of the armament, the revolt of the corps clearly did not have the best effect on the internal situation in the country."
 rcw_nva.86.a:0 "Damn!"
 
 rcw_nva.87.t:0 "Savinkov's death."
 rcw_nva.87.desc:0 "Adventurism and the combination of several positions, combined with personal command of a number of units, caused Savinkov to make a fatal mistake - tired under heavy strain and arriving personally to conduct reconnaissance, Boris Viktorovich came under stray fire from enemy artillery, after which he was found dead."
 rcw_nva.87.a:0 "Disaster!"
 
 rcw_nva.88.t:0 "Liberation from within."
 rcw_nva.88.desc:0 "Today the forces of the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, together with the Czechoslovaks, have successfully organized a series of uprisings in the heartland, possibly stabbing the Bolsheviks in the back fatally.  They are willing to do anything to defeat our enemy and are open to cooperation with all anti-Bolshevik forces."
 rcw_nva.88.a:0 "For Russia."
 rcw_nva.88.b:0 "We will fight our way to their aid."
 
 rcw_nva.89.t:0 "Unintended Consequences"
 rcw_nva.89.desc:0 "It was a good idea to win over the railroad workers, giving them self-government again, but in Bolshevik Russia such freemen had been practiced for quite a long time. And it was one of the main causes of the crisis in transport and the economic crisis in general, because it was foolish to expect things to turn out differently on our side. One conscious service to the cause of fighting demons was not enough to organize a railway connection, and everything seems to be returning to the chaotic status quo."
 rcw_nva.89.a:0 "No way back"
 
 rcw_nva.90.t:0 "Expropriate Expropriators"
 rcw_nva.90.desc:0 "Taking control of a number of key points in Central Russia is remarkable in itself. However, the problem is that these points are large cities, and after the Bolshevik coup and the establishment of commissar power and Soviet freemen there, all the assets of the bourgeoisie were expropriated and taken away pockets of the dregs of society, called conscious proletarians, and the old administration of the still temporary workers was removed from power.And it consisted for the most part of tsarist officials, who under the Bolsheviks began to be called "former", who had not yet had time to be shot for one reason or another, and along with them, officers are called “former” (they, however, are already following us, and do not relate to the current issue), as well as manufacturers. \n\nSince the commissars and Soviet deputies were either shot or fled, the personnel issue needs to be resolved, but contact with these reactionaries who want the restoration of rights to their candle factories will bind us with obligations."
 rcw_nva.90.a:0 "The military administration will deal with recruitment"
 rcw_nva.90.b:0 "Refusing the services of factory owners to restore economic life is stupid..."

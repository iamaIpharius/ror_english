Under their control are the resources of the entire east of Russia and the trust of the peasant masses that has not yet faded. Against the socialists- revolutionaries, the two-headed hydra of reaction - the Bolshevik Black Hundreds on the left and the Black Hundred Bolshevism on the right. However, a more dangerous fact may be the split of the Socialist-Revolutionaries into several political platforms. \nThe so-called "rightists" now have the least influence, their leaders still call for building a broad coalition with all bourgeois parties advocating parliamentarism and a republic. It should be noted that there are fewer and fewer such probable allies - the Cadets openly declare a military dictatorship as the way to save the country. Because of this situation, the rest of the Social Revolutionaries are suspected of being "Right" covert agents of reaction. And yet the "Right" still capable of gaining influence over the army and patriotic elements, if they show to the world a new charismatic leader. \nAnother extreme platform is the party members, who are unofficially referred to as radicals or otherwise "maximalists". These comrades are in favor of deepening the social revolution along the Narodnik axis. This means an increasing transfer of the means of production from the hands of the owners to the hands of the owner-producers. Maximalists consider cultivated land to be the main means of production. Self-government should become more and more - the ideal is a confederation of labor farms, an all-Russian commune. But the main thing is that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks should not fight each other, opening up scope for reaction. Naturally, such extravagant views do not yet find a response from party authorities, but they are perceived with a bang by the people, who until recently welcomed the slogans of the Bolsheviks. \nFinally, the Moderates are the largest, but also the loosest faction. Both conscious opponents of political radicalism and representatives of the “bog” got here. The only advantage of the moderates is the presence in their ranks of several major theorists. For the moment, they put the promotion of democracy in the form of a combination of parliamentarism and self-government at the center of their policy, and also proclaim the old slogan of convening a Constituent Assembly. \nThe struggle between factions and platforms cannot be dodged, but the intensity of the passions will have to be controlled so as not to invite something much more dangerous."

After these words in the form of rumors spread among the party, many of its members firmly thought about the propriety of appointing a new commander-in-chief, one who knows Russia poorly and apparently has a good attitude toward its deposed tsars."

In such a situation, it is necessary to keep a constant eye on the shadow life of society in order to shoot down new Bolsheviks on the takeoff.

Under the Congress such an organ was the militia under the control of the Social Revolutionaries; by purging it of dangerous radicals in general it was possible to preserve the old state of affairs. Also in the army there has always been a small but nevertheless quite effective counterintelligence service - with some help from above it is able to take a leading role among the secret authorities. Finally, during its stay in the Czechs practically created their own network of agents in Russia.

Satisfied Social Revolutionaries, who had organized part of the riots, rubbed their hands together in the hope of regaining all power. The army had to quell their fervor by hinting transparently that counterintelligence was in fact at work. While negotiations were underway, the troops conducted several lightning raids on the villages. Provided that the very demonstration of force led to peace - and all the troubles were attributed to the activities of the Czechs - the troops were a bloodless success. In the cities, the army was also feared - during the civil war the number of workers had grown smaller, their fighting spirit had weakened, and for many it already seemed completely pointless to lose their lives in the new party meat grinder. In fact, the crisis turned out to be a bubble. \nWhile the hardened schemer from the army solved their problems with the SRs, Sergei Voitsekhovsky arrived to manage the capital. He was able to quickly restore order and get the basic infrastructure up and running.

They needed only an opportune moment, a set of circumstances in which neither the Czechs nor the army would be able or willing to protect the general.

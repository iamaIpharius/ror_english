 turkey.2.t:0 "A military governor for Hijaz?"
 turkey.2.desc:0 "After the suppression of the uprising, the pro-Turkish sheriff of Mecca, Ali Haydar Pasha ibn Jabir, was reinstated. His power rests solely on the Turkish gendarmerie and this is no secret to anyone. The presence of the Turkish armed forces here will drag on, so it will be necessary to choose an officer most capable of dealing with tasks of a military, but also of a political, economic nature. The first option that comes to mind is Cemal Pasha. He has already successfully crushed all resistance in Syria and was able to coerce the moderates of the national Arab movement to cooperate. He could easily repeat this experience in Arabia. However, the suppression by force in the natural conditions of the peninsula might be delayed. Therefore, it is possible to appoint Talaat Pasha, who is more inclined to compromise with the locals, as Governorate-General. However, the activities of both could be complicated by personal contradictions. Therefore, it is rational to pay attention to the young cadres in the Turkish army. Thus Galliopoli's hero, Mustafa Kemal is a promising candidate for the post. Should he succeed in reconciling Hijaz, he could indeed be of great benefit to Turkey."

Turkish armed forces will be deployed in the country, Turkish control over the Hijaz railroad will be maintained, and numerous concessions have been made in the religious sphere. Most importantly, the Hashemites have taken the formal oath. Turkey may even have benefited from the treaty."

 turkey.85.desc:0 "From several reports Enver Pasha learned that some private conversations indirectly mentioned a certain meeting between two other triumvirs. The only thing suspicious about this is that Enver was completely uninformed about it. Is this a conspiracy? It may well be. Enver Pasha has already taken steps to strengthen his personal guard."

 turkey.86.desc:0 "The army units, as soon as the first deaths occurred and there was a real danger of an escalation of a full-fledged civil war, declared neutrality. Low morale and unwillingness to fight for another Young Turk, almost the same. After that, the fate of Enver and his few supporters was sealed. After a protracted firefight, he was found among the dead. Now only two important figures remain in Turkish politics, who have already assured each other of friendship and harmony."

 turkey.87.t:0 "Opposition mutiny!"
 turkey.87.desc:0 "The fighting in the capital has been considerably delayed. Having achieved nothing and having used up almost all their supplies, the rebel armed forces were forced to retreat to their regional base. On the one hand, this means that full-scale fighting is inevitable. On the other hand, there is hope for their swift defeat, because they are not proposing any reforms and, accordingly, have no credibility among the people..."

The team has already taken the now former leader of the country into custody and the German command is busy selecting a less conflicted official who can actually serve as a conduit for German interests.

His motives are clear - leaving his loyalists in Syria, he is going to take over an even richer region, which will seriously increase his influence over Turkish politics. This will be extremely disadvantageous. On the other hand, refusing to satisfy him will cause a deadly feud with him..."

In an obedient government parliament, an MP drew attention to the scale of theft in the fiefdom of Cemal Pasha, which had reached such proportions that evidence of the predatory exploitation of the local population and the volume of the illegal silk trade had penetrated even into government-controlled newspapers. Cemal Pasha demanded in a crude letter not to interfere in his affairs and to silence all those who pay attention to him, considering his activities quite permissible. Indeed, any attempt to conduct an investigation would lead to a deadly feud... Especially considering that [TUR.GetLeader] himself is implicated in corruption."

 armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "Due to the declining role of cavalry, armored cars and tanks have become more important in many countries. Armored cars have been constantly improved and models have been created that are specialized for reconnaissance and infantry support tasks."

 armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "Due to the cheapness of relatively light tanks and sufficient combat effectiveness, armored cars continued to develop for some time after the First World War. In the end, by the Second World War they finally lost their potential for development, although they remained quite effective."

Early tanks were slow, armed with machine guns and small caliber cannons, and their armor could protect only from small arms."

 artillery_equipment_1_9_desc:0 "Before the war, the value of artillery capable of hitting further than 4 km was downplayed, and no one thought about firing at a distance of more than 6 km for light field artillery. In French artillery, firing at long ranges was condemned as heresy by both the charter and the authorities, and in in peacetime, artillery was not practiced in it. The World War forced a sharp change in this view on the value of range. As a result of many innovations in the army, the depth of defense could reach 10 km. This created the need for increased range and power, perhaps the next war will be similar to that one. Further developments in this direction further increased the range and power of the guns."

 WW1_oil2_desc:0 "Oil hides from us deep underground where no one can find it.

 WW1_fortification4_desc:0 "The development of aviation has brought new problems to consider when building defensive structures. It is much more difficult to rebuild trenches when bombs are falling on you. Anti-aircraft guns will help us defend our forts even in modern warfare."

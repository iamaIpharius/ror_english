 finland.1.t:0 "Revolution in Russia?!"
 finland.1.desc:0 "In Finland at the beginning of 1917, on the eve of the revolution in Russia, a mood prevailed which in no way foreshadowed rapid change. In Europe, meanwhile, the war was in its third year, claiming the lives of millions of people. The Grand Duchy of Finland, unlike other parts of the Russian Empire, remained aloof from the fighting. The reason for that was Russia's mistrust of the Finns and the stubbornness of the Finns themselves. The Finnish nation had for many years staunchly resisted the Russification policy pursued by the tsarist administration in Finland. In the meantime, the people in Finland were living with the usual, everyday concerns: where and how to get food, what to do with the rapidly depreciating money, how to live until next summer with an empty cellar and lack of firewood. At the moment not many people are interested in independence of the Finnish state, only small groups in the underground hatch plans to seize power and end the "Russian oppression". The arrest of Governor General Zane and the formation of a new coalition Senate throws oil on the fire."

The outcome of the Bolshevik uprising is not yet clear, but the position of the Provisional Government is very shaky, which gives hope of independence from Russia in the near future. The Social-Democratic faction of the parliament proposes its own bill, which gives it supreme power in the internal affairs of Finland, and limits the competence of the Provisional Government in military and foreign affairs..."

The Provisional Government was declared deposed, the Soviet of People's Commissars was formed, and the transfer of all power to the Soviet organs was proclaimed. It means that the only force which holds Finland in Russia are the Russian garrisons, but they are not a force without a united command and are morally decayed. The new Petrograd Government is thus favorable to the right of peoples to self-determination and seems ready to recognize our independence."

 finland.12.desc:0 "In 1917, when the disbanded police had ceased to maintain order, self-defense squads spontaneously began to arise almost throughout Finland. The same functions were performed by the Finnish Red Guard units. However, the former were supporters of the predominantly bourgeois Finnish Senate, while the latter were supporters of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, which often led to armed clashes."

 finland.13.t:0 "Disarming Russian garrisons".
 finland.13.desc:0 "The number of the old tsarist army in Finland before the declaration of independence was about 100,000 men. During the first two months their number began to decrease, both because they were regrouped and demobilized for withdrawal from Finnish territory to Russia, and because of the loss of discipline and growth of desertion. Trying not to miss the opportunity to get arms, the White Guards decided to disarm the Russian garrisons on their own, while engaging in armed confrontation with them and brutally liquidating the prisoners."
 finland.13.a:0 "We will monitor the situation."
 
 finland.14.t:0 "Arming the Red Guard"
 finland.14.desc:0 "Intensive formation of the Finnish Red Guard began immediately after the fall of the Russian monarchy. The Red Guard was created by left-wing socialists associated with the Russian Bolsheviks. The rank and file was formed mainly from workers, rarely from the rural poor. A large part of the Red Guards were women and adolescents. At the same time, the command posts were occupied by "revolutionaries", Marxist intellectuals and journalists. Some had experience as officers in the Russian tsarist army."

The Red Guard occupied the capital and a revolutionary Soviet of the People's Commissioners of Finland was established. Swinhuvud's Senate fled to Vaasa. Large areas of the north remain under government control, the guard units and jaegers gather in an organized structure to oppose the revolution."

 finland.20.t: "Our King!"
 finland.20.desc: "The Finnish parliament decided, by 41 votes out of 64, to elect a king, based on Article 38 of the Swedish Form of Government Act of 1772. The article stated that if the ruling clan was interrupted, a new king could be elected. As the Emperor Nikolay II of Russia had abdicated (among other things, from the throne of the Grand Duchy of Finland), and as no one had legally laid claim to the Finnish throne, this permitted the use of the existing law. This same provision of the law some time ago enabled Eduskunta to declare the independence of the country. The Republicans and Social Democrats boycotted the vote, in which about a third of the deputies (64 out of 200) took part. The candidates for the throne are many, but the most important are: the son of the German Emperor Oscar - not a bad option for rapprochement with Germany, Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin - another German prince, Friedrich Carl of Hesse-Kassel - and another prince son of King Gustav V of Sweden, Wilhelm - after all Sweden is closer to us than Germany, and the son of Wilhelm - Lennart, school age."

 rcw_amrprm.1.t:0 "Amur Committee of Public Order"
 rcw_amrprm.1.desc:0 "The establishment of Soviet authority in remote regions is difficult both because of communication complications and because of the active activity of the opponents of the Socialist Revolution. In Blagoveshchensk, where the news of it reached only two weeks later, at a meeting of the Cossack Host commanders, the city Duma and right-wing parties, a regional Committee of Public Order was established, consisting of the SRs Nikolay Kozhevnikov and Alexander Alexeyevskiy, and the ataman Ivan Gamov. The Zemstvo Assembly, together with the CUP, opposed the current government, calling it rebellious and usurpatory. Fortunately, there are still Communist cells active in the region fighting the Socialist regional government."

 rcw_amrprm.2.t:0 "The Blagoveshchensky Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies"
 rcw_amrprm.2.desc:0 "The Bolshevik faction, which was strengthening its position in the city every day, finally made its move. It was announced that henceforth the Blagoveshchensk Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies would assume all administrative functions in Blagoveshchensk. To a certain extent, this "coup d'état" succeeded, but the right-wing Committee of Public Order still continues to function. Neither side yet has sufficient resources to finally resolve the situation of the established dual power. "

 rcw_amrprm.3.t:0 "Gamow Mutiny."
 rcw_amrprm.3.desc:0 "After a few weeks of tense confrontation, the political forces of Priamurye moved to open confrontation. After the Bolsheviks issued several unpopular decrees and declared themselves the only power in the region, Ataman Gamov, one of the CUP members, decided to disband the Soviet by force. Within a day, a detachment of cadets, Cossacks and civil police disarmed the garrison of Blagoveshchensk, seized key objects of the city and arrested the members of the executive committee of the Soviet. \nThe Bolsheviks, who escaped arrest with the support of the sailors of the Amur Flotilla formed a military revolutionary committee, which settled in Alexandrovsky. Both sides began large-scale mobilization. "

 rcw_amrprm.4.t:0 "Order restored."
 rcw_amrprm.4.desc:0 "After a series of battles in the countryside, Bolshevik forces are finally knocked out of Priamurye. Some members of the Soviet with the remnants of their detachments went north, joining the partisans, while others retreated behind the Chinese border. Now the CUP, actually led by Gamow, is beginning to restore the order that existed before the Bolshevik coup. The only question is what the new government will be."
 rcw_amrprm.4.a:0 "A civilian government must be restored."
 rcw_amrprm.4.b:0 "Only the Cossacks will keep the region from chaos."
 
 rcw_amrprm.5.t:0 "V Peasant Congress"
 rcw_amrprm.5.desc:0 "Having ended Gamow's reactionary mutiny, the Annunciation Soviet was finally able to consolidate the revolutionary changes. Zemstvos and city self-government were finally abolished, a dry law was introduced, and the radical socialization of private property continued. In addition to administrative and economic questions, the congress also determined the status of the Priamurye, proclaiming a Soviet republic within the RSFSR."

 rcw_amrprm.6.t:0 "II Host Circle of the Amur Cossack Host."
 rcw_amrprm.6.desc:0 "The newly convened circle discussed mainly matters of defense and mobilization, which had become especially important in light of recent events, as well as finally confirmed the rejection of decommissioning, the republican position of the army and the writing off of all army debts. However, the most important decision was proclamation of the host government as the supreme authority in the Amur region. And in the current situation there is no one to challenge such claims. "
 rcw_amrprm.6.a:0 "God is with us!"
 
 rcw_amrprm.7.t:0 "Inflow of Anarchists"
 rcw_amrprm.7.desc:0 "Recently the infamous anarchist and robber Perezhogin and his men crossed the border of the region. Arriving in Blagoveshchensk by train after robbing a bank in Chita, this well-armed gang destabilized the situation in the city, paying with chopped pieces of gold everywhere, arranging new robberies, and even expanding. Even the power structures came under pressure. Thus, Perezhogin everywhere demands to recognize his right to unlimited requisitions and confiscations. "
 rcw_amrprm.7.a:0 "Sooner or later this rabble will disperse."
 rcw_amrprm.7.b:0 "We have to get rid of this bandit."
 
 rcw_amrprm.8.t:0 "Battle for the Market Square"
 rcw_amrprm.8.desc:0 "With the connivance of the government and the support of the leftist Social Revolutionaries, Perezhogin has turned his gang into a real military unit. Gathering under his banner ideological anarchists and various gangs, he formed a "revolutionary division" from them, obtaining several machine guns and even a field gun. The advance of these forces on Blagoveshchensk took the garrison, which had lost its vigilance and underestimated the threat, by surprise. Some troops were disarmed without any resistance, the headquarters of the city garrison was fired from a cannon, and the most combat-ready troops fought on the central Market Square. After the remnants of the garrison were defeated, the government fled the city, hiding in Chinese territory, and some of its members were captured or killed while attempting to flee. The city was overwhelmed by a wave of looting and reprisals, many administrative organs were abolished, and the troops left ungoverned were again sent home."
 rcw_amrprm.8.a:0 "Such is the price of freedom."
 
 rcw_amrprm.9.t:0 "Shootout on Big Street."
 rcw_amrprm.9.desc:0 "After a tense struggle with Perezhogin's heavily armed bandits, they were finally dealt with. During one of the shootouts in the streets, the leader of the anarchists was killed. It is not established whether he was killed by a government unit or by one of his former comrades-in-arms, but without a leader the remaining troublemakers quickly ceased to pose a threat."
 rcw_amrprm.9.a:0 "Bandits have no place in politics."
 
 rcw_amrprm.10.t:0 "II congress of the Amur grain growers"
 rcw_amrprm.10.desc:0 "Monopolization of power, radical socialization, and inaction on economic problems have caused widespread dissatisfaction with the current government. The activity of the opposition forces culminated in an SR-Menshevik congress in the village of Peschanoozyorskoye, which elected its own executive committee, claiming supreme power in the region. And now this executive committee demands the release of the counter-revolutionaries from prison, the dissolution of the mobilized and even the transfer of power. And what's more, they are already preparing to form a 'green army' to fight the Soviets."
 rcw_amrprm.10.a:0 "We will deal with this control as well."
 rcw_amrprm.10.b:0 "Down with murderers and thieves!"
 
 rcw_amrprm.11.t:0 "New and Old Allies"
 rcw_amrprm.11.desc:0 "Other anti-Bolshevik forces also became more active with the beginning of the open rebellion against the Blagoveshchensk Soviet. Gamov's Cossacks and other participants in the first anti-communist protest returned from Chinese territory, and more and more interventionist troops, primarily Japanese, entered the region. The war for the region is increasingly shaping up in our favor. "
 rcw_amrprm.11.a:0 "Victory is near."
 
 rcw_amrprm.12.t:0 "Provisional Government"
 rcw_amrprm.12.desc:0 "With the entry of troops into Blagoveshchensk and the release of political prisoners, a provisional regional government was quickly formed in the city, including both representatives of anti-Bolshevik parties and Cossacks. Only the question of who would be the chairman of this government remains undecided."
 rcw_amrprm.12.a:0 "Alekseevsky is the best candidate."
 rcw_amrprm.12.b:0 "The Menshevik Zemstvites will defend their candidate."
 
 rcw_amrprm.13.t:0 "Atamanshchina"
 rcw_amrprm.13.desc:0 "Despite recognition and even participation in government activities, Ataman Gamov and his Cossacks often conduct a virtually independent policy on the ground. Cases of exceeding authority and even simple senseless violence are not uncommon. This does not add popularity or stability to the government, but it is not possible to stop such activities now."
 rcw_amrprm.13.a:0 "We have no other army."
 
 rcw_amrprm.14.t:0 "Trans-Baikal Intervention"
 rcw_amrprm.14.desc:0 "A certain centurion Ilya Shemelin arrived in Blagoveshchensk from Transbaikalia with a small detachment. Referring to the order of his superior, who claims military supremacy in all Eastern Siberia, he intends to take the post of commandant of Blagoveshchensk and take command of the regional troops "to maintain order." And since this appointment is also supported by Gamov, we have no more opportunity to refuse."

 rcw_amrprm.15.t:0 "Replace Commandant"
 rcw_amrprm.15.desc:0 "The excessive despotism and incompetence of Shemelin, who has usurped power in the region, seems to have exhausted the patience of all forces operating in the region. Representatives of the regional zemstvo, General Horvath and even the Japanese have already made demands to remove him from his position. The latter especially threaten the position of the commandant with the possibility of removing him by force."
 rcw_amrprm.15.a:0 "The troops will be led by Gamov, and the government by Alexeyevskiy."
 rcw_amrprm.15.b:0 "Shut up the Zemstvos and strengthen the guards."
 
 rcw_amrprm.16.t:0 "Apotheosis of Intervention"
 rcw_amrprm..desc:0 "Abuse of power and shortsightedness in relations with the Allies eventually played a cruel joke on Shemelin. After the commandant refused to resign despite the Japanese troops' support of the zemstvo's demand, the Japanese moved to take decisive action. Despite attempts at resistance, the garrison of Blagoveshchensk was disarmed, warehouses were seized, and a direct Japanese military administration was established in the city itself. "

 rcw_amrprm.16.b:0 "No! Mobilization... reserves... garrisons..."
 
 rcw_amrprm.17.t:0 "Taking Khabarovsk"
 rcw_amrprm.17.desc:0 "The entry of our troops into Khabarovsk was a turning point in the region. Cossack detachments of Ataman Kalmykov, who had previously waged war against the Bolsheviks in the region and had attempted to take the city, were now helping to establish order. The capture of such a transport hub and, no less importantly, the center of the Ussuri Cossacks is undoubtedly an important milestone in the struggle for the Far East."

The turnout was expectedly low and uneven, and the deputies' ability to make decisions was limited not only by party and factional squabbles, but also by pressure from the Cossacks, interventionists, and other outside forces. Nevertheless, after many days of wrangling and postponed votes, at least the question of power and foreign policy was resolved."

The Czechs then occupied the Soviet's residence and forcibly disarmed the Red Guard, which offered no resistance, except for a group gathered in the fortress headquarters... This group surrendered after two hours of fighting with rifles, machine guns and hand grenades. No exact casualty figures are available yet, but it appears that no more than 15 men were killed and about 40 wounded. The Japanese and British have landed large armed landing parties in the town, but they did not take part in the fighting. Admiral Knight tonight landed a small unit of sailors for the sole purpose of protecting the consulate. At the request of the Czechs, Japanese and British patrols were withdrawn everywhere except the consulates, and the Czechs themselves took to the streets, which saved the city from annexation by foreign interventionists, but resulted in the final establishment of white power in the city, friendly to the interventionists and hostile to the workers' and peasants' government."

Horvat, the chief of CEL. It seems his ambitions extend to all of Siberia, but it is the reaction of Primor'ye authorities that matters now. Of course, the general is supported by right-wing forces, but in fact they have no means to seize power in Vladivostok. As a result, recognition of the claims of the 'provisional ruler' is entirely in the goodwill of the government of Primorskiy Krai."

The question for us is, do we recognize that [OVERLORD.GetLeader] has the right to rule, or do we go free-wheeling? On the one hand, the fact that [OVERLORD.GetName] gives us patronage will allow us to have more power in both domestic and foreign policy. The other point of view is that there is nothing they can do to help us that we could not do, and would rather pull the 'juice' from Primor'ye itself."

Allegedly, only his genius could rectify the situation and end the war with the capture of Moscow. It is no secret that Gaida has certain connections with some part of the Social Revolutionary Party. At the same time there are rumors about his dictatorial ambitions. It is likely that our refusal of the Czech's demands will mean either his voluntary resignation or an attempted coup.

At this time the troops loyal to [PRM.GetLeader] were in complete peace in their barracks. Many of them were caught there by the rebels and forced to surrender immediately. The Officers' School on Russky Island resisted the longest, but artillery fire from Vladivostok, as well as news of their flight to Japan [PRM.GetLeader], forced these cadets to surrender as well."

In only a few hours the rebel general occupied all the main points of Vladivostok, and part of the Eserov government, which had been formed the day before, went over to his side. Active defense, deployed only the Korean internationalists and partisans, subordinate to the Bolshevik Party, but the suddenness of the attack did not allow them to concentrate in one point. Gaida considered his case already won and, not caring to properly control the already cleared areas of the city, did not notice the arrival of the new train at the station. Cossacks on foot, led by Ataman Kalmykov, poured out of the train cars. At the conditional signal - the sevenfold whistle of the locomotive - his cavalrymen also entered the city from the outside. Gaida's troops capitulated everywhere or were hacked to pieces. The mutineer himself, while trying to flee to the American military ships, was killed by a bomb from an SR terrorist, later hanged by the Kalmyks. Now Vladivostok is in full power of the ataman, who proclaimed himself "dictator on behalf of the Cossacks". His program is of a confused character and filled with promises for absolutely different layers of a society, however the key role is assigned to the Cossacks.

 rcw_amrprm.112.desc:0 "[GetDateText] The Semenovites and Kappelevites, with the help of Japanese troops who had disarmed and blockaded the People's Guard forces, carried out a coup in Vladivostok. The immediate executor of the plot was the Semenov National Revolutionary Committee, led by General Lebedev. However, soon the Kappelevites seized the initiative, and the Committee transferred power to the Soviet of the Congress of the non-socialist population of the Far East (so it became known as the Soviet of the Congress of the "Nessos"). The Soviet declared itself the Provisional Priamursky Government. It consisted of S. D. Merkulov (Chairman), I. I. Yeremeev, A. Y. Makarevich, E. M. Anderson and N.D. Merkulov (the leadership of the "National Democratic Union"). The Statement of the Soviet, which became known as the Constitution, outlined the basic goals and principles of the new regime's policy. The government declared itself "the bearer of a supreme power independent of anyone," a "non-partisan institution," and qualified the RCP(b) and persons sympathetic to it as criminal. "The Far Eastern Army and its command supported the new authority."

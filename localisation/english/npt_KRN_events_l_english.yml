In this universal sense, the war with Germany has the meaning of the defense not only of our New Free Fatherland, but of Freedom in general. The monarchies of the Hohenzollerns and the Habsburgs should be overthrown as well as the monarchy of the Romanovs. But there is also another point of view - to wait for the defeat of the Russian Empire from the central empires, and them from the Entente and thus get all their own without getting dirty in a new confrontation with the Kaiser."

But the soldiers did not want to go against the people and rebelled against the government. Together with the people they seized arms, military stores and a number of important government offices. The struggle is still going on; it must be brought to an end. The old power must be finally overthrown and give way to the rule of the people. In this is Russia's salvation. For the successful completion of the struggle in the interests of democracy, the people must establish their own power organization. \nThe delegates nominate three revolutionary leaders, leaders of the masses and friends of the people, for the position of chairman of the permanent executive committee of the Petrosoviet!"

The sailors became a formidable force destroying everything in their path and ruthless to the enemies of the Revolution. At times the Balts are even too radical, because they are strongly influenced by anarchism. But the influence of the Tsentrobalt, headed by the odious sailor leader Pavel Dybenko, is also strong. He obeys the orders of the political leadership less and less, engaging more and more in demagogy and creating his own cult among the sailors, as he believes he should be given a higher role in the leadership.

You know, you yourselves, risking your lives under the bullets of the tsarist punishers, overthrew that regime! But to the great misfortune of Petrograd the torch was not seen by the whole of Russia...". The speaker held out a dramatic pause. The main content of the speech was unclear. During the period of instability in Petrograd there was a fairly large number of public meetings of quite different, though always revolutionary, orientation. All sorts of things were said. Naturally, such "rubbish" soon became boring. But this time there was a reason to gather. The speaker was helped in organizing the meeting by people with red armbands and rifles, but not by soldiers or sailors. "Your impulse was enough to crush them in Petrograd, but now, the continuation of the struggle requires centralized leadership of the uprising." The people did not react, as they decided that it was going to be about the elections, about which so much has been talked about lately. "We, the workers of the Vyborg side, were the first to raise arms during the revolution and have already organized armed detachments at the enterprises of our district - the Red Guard! Sign up too, you, only together can we defeat the tsarist punishers!" A buzz of excitement began, right up to loud discussion of the speaker's words. Shlyapnikov realized that not everyone yet realized that the struggle would not be limited to arresting the policemen. A voice rang out from the crowd: "Personally, I fully agree with the speaker, let him go to the front!" The Bolshevik didn't shoot back and despite the laughter among the crowd he parried, "-What about you? Comrade Ivanov?Now, Comrade Ivanov, is it true that every infantry unit has an infirmary and an organized supply of ammunition and food? -It's clear to me. -I'm a member of the Revolutionary Defense Board and directly responsible for supplying those units. -Let's see how you supply them! We'll send a delegation to you, and if we see that you don't lie, we'll sign up with the whole shop! -I demand nothing more from you personally, Comrade Ivanov, and your comrades!"

"Why do you keep your brothers in arms at gunpoint?" asked Kerensky loudly to the soldiers of the Tsarskoselsk garrison, who were now not so much upset and really took aim at him and the soldiers from the free detachment that had already been left behind. They didn't shoot back either and raised their weapons, too. There was no response. Alexander Fyodorovich was afraid that someone would not stand up and shoot him, but he managed to hide it. "Have the traitors, who have blabbed on about us, fled to your dispensation? Look, I, the deputy of the State Duma, Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, defender of the people, and behind me there are not German agents, but...", then finally there came the "-Shut up, you corrupt dog! -Ah, it's you, Colonel!". Kerensky decided to take advantage of the fact that the enemy could not stand it and he began to brag deliberately: "Are you accusing me of treason? All right. And shooting at your own people, is that not treason? -You have all been paid by Germany! -Not more expensive than your Order of St. George, which you earned by shedding a river of blood of the same people you command now. -Stop lying! We were only defending ourselves, loyal to our oath! -Would you suggest that the soldiers of the garrison go to the city? There they can see with their own eyes the German soldiers and... -You betrayed your country at war, you scoundrels, and of course you want to trap us! You deserve to be shot on the spot!" It must be said that either because Kerensky was quite convincing or because the sight of the soldiers of the Petrograd garrison and the rumors that reached Tsarskoye Selo made them doubt the words of Kutepov, the Tsarskoye Selo garrison began to waver. Already not everyone (including the "Petrograders") held their rifles at the ready, and some of those standing close to the remnants of the colonel's detachment took a few steps away from them. "-So why have you still not opened fire? Comrades, don't become accomplices of the tyrant...." Someone couldn't stand it, though, and fired. There was a commotion. Kerensky fell to the ground and only by a miracle was not hurt. He even managed to take part in the completion of the shooting by picking up his rifle from the dead. When things calmed down, it became clear that most of the soldiers of the Tsarskoye Selo garrison had gone over to the side of the revolution and helped in the fight. Kutepov was not among those killed."

The brilliant prospect of leading the revolution had obscured all his thoughts. As a member of the defense Soviet he was more concerned with building his image. He was very active and travelled a lot around the front, making speeches, following publications, interfering in the leadership of units, in general he created a portrait of a people's hero in broad strokes. However, he resisted getting a specific position, because his status as a member of the defense Soviet, due to the instability of the revolutionary times, gave him unexhausted and unlimited powers.

Otherwise, deputies threatened not to attend meetings, due to which the Petrosoviet would not have a quorum for decision-making. This statement indicated deep political contradictions in the Commune and possibly a political crisis. Indeed, no party had absolute support among the population. Even in the Red Guard units, whose formation had been initiated by the Bolsheviks, not everyone was loyal to this party, since not all workers' collectives were sympathetic to their radical demands. The struggle for the triumph of the revolution had not yet hardened the population enough. The Bolsheviks were in a difficult position. It was clear that there was no chance of justifying an honest victory, because the Mensheviks and SRs were already in an uncharted alliance and God knows how far this cooperation would go.

 rcw.101.desc:0 "After a severe drought in 1921, in many regions of Russia, and in particular in the Volga region, about 22% of the total crop died, as a result of which famine raged there. According to some party members, the causes of the famine also lie in the inefficient implementation of the surplus appropriation, as a result of which the peasants lost part of the sowing seeds and necessary food products, which led to a further reduction in the acreage and grain harvests. The absence of a legal private market for bread, in the absence of any significant stocks of grain from the governments of the Soviet republics, the devastation of transport, and the new institutions of power that had just begun their activities also caused the famine. \nUnrest has begun among the peasants, we are required to do something immediately to stop the famine."

 rcw.102.desc:0 "The war dragged on. Hundreds of thousands of people drafted into the armies of the warring parties for too long killed each other and ate Russia. Few industrial centers hit by fighting and food shortages. Even bagging has disappeared. There is nothing left to speculate in the country. Pre-revolutionary securities and even precious metals lost their value against the backdrop of the impossibility of satisfying vital needs. Eights of bread (125 grams) have become an integral part of Russian reality. Corpse-eating is too common. The urban population has declined significantly. The food crisis has become almost insoluble due to the lack of people to control the territories. Peasants, regardless of their wealth, flock to the local chieftains, not paying attention to the color of his banner. The poor and laborers are looking for an opportunity to satisfy their minimum living needs by force, since there are practically no alternatives due to the degradation of the economy. All independent owners seek protection from confiscations by other parties to the conflict in them. Frightened by instability, wealthy owners will only accumulate funds for a long time to come. Economic ties between the regions are severed. Most of the equipment in factories has fallen into disrepair due to a long service life. Neither the Bolshevik planning bodies, nor the old owners of industrial enterprises were able to cope with the ever-increasing consequences of the war. The winner gets only the ruins."

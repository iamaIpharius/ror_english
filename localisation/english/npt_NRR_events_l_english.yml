 rcw_nrr.100.desc:0 "The path of Russian democracy was hard and difficult - autocracy strangled it for a long time, the revolution gave the country a chance, but the chosen ones who took the helm could not cope with the ship that flew into the firestorm and all the achievements, all the rights and freedoms, the expression of the people's will in the form of the Constituent Assembly was trampled and crushed by the radical Bolsheviks. The patriots did not give up, and having a righteous goal, they worked to achieve it already underground. Fate managed to laugh - what was accepted as the main plan ended in failure, despite huge opportunities and resources. Brought north by chance, Nikolay Tchaikovsky, following essentially a backup plan, led a mockery of the original ideas - surrounded by people who poorly understand the ideas of the Supreme Administration, with a handful of troops in the middle of a vast, sparsely populated north, against a saturated industrial center. However, a constant , the great work of the grandpa of the Russian Revolution and his associates, the courage, skills and heroism of the soldiers AT and officers did something that could not be achieved only by the brute force of bayonets and executions - an unstoppable offensive, including by significant forces of former Red Army soldiers who realized the abyss into which they were plunged by the anti-people power. original conditions - overgrown with flesh, the original ideals, albeit subjected to inevitable changes, remained basically the same. What Nikolay Vasilyevich Tchaikovsky strove for most of his long and eventful life, with the end of the civil war, finally gained the breath of life - Russia became a free, popular, democratic, national country, and this is the great merit of the elderly revolutionary. And although there is still a lot of work to be done, one thing is for sure - the Russian people from now on will consciously decide their own fate."

 ukraine.-60.d:0 "Skoropadsky arrived at the meeting with the Directory without guards. This was their indispensable condition. Surprisingly, no one arrested him on the spot. The parties fairly quickly came to an agreement. Hetman would withdraw his troops from the southern outskirts of Kiev and the troops loyal to the Directory would occupy the city unhindered. At that moment Skoropadsky would publish an appeal to the people, in which he would declare his abdication and the transfer of all power to the Directory. In exchange for this unhindered surrender Skoropadsky will not be prosecuted and will return to his former rank in the army."

Skoropadsky was looking for a combination in which the most painless way out of the situation would occur. But it seems that the game was not fair from the beginning. Less than an hour after the commander-in-chief left, a detachment of cadets came to Skoropadsky. The head of state went out into the street under escort. In a few more minutes he was standing in front of the future officers. The commander of the squad read out Keller's orders."

 ukraine.-56.t:0 "The Last Assault"
 ukraine.-56.d:0 "The Petlyurovs encircled Kiev from the west and north and began to storm the city. This deprived the defenders of the advantage of the disposition and gave the Directory the opportunity to realize its own numerical superiority. If even one enemy unit broke through the line of defense, there would be nothing to stop them and the continuation of the battle would become pointless. The chance of holding the Ukrainians is negligible..."

 ukraine.-54.t:0 "The Petliurovts have stopped."
 ukraine.-54.d:0 "The retreating German units unexpectedly intervened in the fight for the capital.

 ukraine.-53.d:0 "Appointed Commander-in-Chief Keller displays deliberate willfulness in his activities.

 ukraine.-52.a:0 "Shoot them all!"
 ukraine.-51.t:0 "The siege of Kiev has dragged on."
 ukraine.-51.d:0 "Another attempt to storm the capital ended in failure. The Petlyurovs failed to break into the city. The main reason for the failure of the operation - the offensive was conducted only in the southern direction. This limited the offensive front for the Direktorium forces, and also allowed the defenders of the city to achieve a greater density of troops."
 ukraine.-51.a:0 "There is still an opportunity to turn the tide of the battle..."
 ukraine.-50.t:0 "Storm the city."
 ukraine.-50.d:0 "The initial failure has cooled the ardor of the Directory. This, however, has greatly troubled them so far, for time is by no means playing on Skoropadsky's side. Smaller insurgent detachments are flocking to their rate, replacing those killed and wounded. This trend is unlikely to change, so prolonging the battle will bring them victories. However, it will prolong powerlessness and worsen the situation of the country. Therefore, Petliura plans an attack on the city."
 ukraine.-50.a:0 "If they break through the defenses, all is lost."
 ukraine.-49.t:0 "Appoint Keller as commander-in-chief?"
 ukraine.-49.d:0 "Due to the dire situation, the hetman could use any opportunity to strengthen his position. Most of the forces defending him were by no means Ukrainian units, but formations of Russian officers. The cavalry general Fyodor Koehler has the greatest authority among them. His appointment as commander-in-chief will raise morale and facilitate interaction between the units.
 ukraine.-49.a:0 "Keller is appointed commander-in-chief."
 ukraine.-49.b:0 "He's too ambitious."
 ukraine.-48.t:0 "Siege of Kiev"
 ukraine.-48.d:0 "It did not work to defeat the rioters and occupy the White Church. They did not scatter when the attack began and were able to offer organized resistance. The detachment that was rashly sent to attack suffered heavy losses and had to retreat to avoid being defeated. Because of this, we were forced to abandon the Motovilovka railway station. Now the front runs closer to the city line. We did not manage to defeat the insurgency with little blood."
 ukraine.-48.a:0 "The situation is becoming tense..."
 ukraine.-47.t:0 "Suppression of rebellion"
 ukraine.-47.d:0 "The long and persistent siege of the capital finally ended with our victory. Fight-weary Ukrainian and other rebel units withdrew from the city. Our army was able to regain control of the rest of the country outside the capital. The rebels, however, have not been defeated. They have only retreated to prepare their forces for a new strike. The battle for Ukraine is just beginning."
 ukraine.-47.d_1:0 "The first onslaught of Ukrainian units was heavy. We were forced to retreat all the way to the city line. However, the battle was hard on both sides. The most combat-ready insurgents were killed. Our counterattack on the weakened units, which could not even form a solid front, allowed us to defeat them completely and scatter the survivors. Henceforth all power in Ukraine actually belongs to the White Guards."
 ukraine.-47.d_2:0 "The main insurgent forces were defeated near the Motovilovka railway station.  We underestimated them by organizing a frontal attack against, as it turned out, a comparable force in number. However, the training of the cadets took its toll. The rebels were unable to take advantage of our mistake, and our reinforcements soon arrived. In a few hours all the rebelling against the hetman was eliminated. Henceforth all the power in the Ukraine actually belongs to the White Guards."
 ukraine.-47.a:0 "Kiev is a Russian city."
 ukraine.-46.t:0 "Liberation of Kiev"
 ukraine.-46.d:0 "The long and persistent siege of the capital finally ended with our victory. Fight-weary units of reactionary soldiers and officers finally stopped clinging to the specter of restoring their despotic regime and scattered. Ukrainian units, breaking the scattered resistance, led by Petlyura entered Kiev. Henceforth all the fullness of power in Ukraine belongs to the directorate."
 ukraine.-46.d_1:0 "Although the first attack was stopped even before the city limits of Kiev began, the position of the Hetman's forces remained precarious. Continuing the onslaught made it possible to break through the outer defenses. In the street battles the enemy units were completely helpless. Demoralized reactionary units scattered, realizing the futility of further confrontation. Henceforth all power in Ukraine belongs to the directorate."
 ukraine.-46.d_2:0 "Our units entered Kiev to the aid of the rebels and were able to gain control of the city by dispersing the few enemy detachments. The battle-weary bands of reactionary soldiers and officers finally stopped clinging to the specter of restoring their despotic regime and scattered. Henceforth the fullness of power in Ukraine belongs to the directorate."
 ukraine.-46.d_3:0 "Near the railway station of Motovilovka the main hetman's forces were defeated. The self-confident officers thought that the Ukrainian units would collapse when the real battle began. This miscalculation allowed them to be caught in a firebag from the flanks and destroyed most of their personnel. Thus died the last hope of the regime. Units under Petlura's command entered the capital in columns without encountering any resistance. Henceforth all power in Ukraine belongs to the directorate."

After this decision Skoropadsky had no support left. Thanks to his policies, the Ukrainian forces did not represent anything worthwhile.

After this decision Skoropadsky had no support left. Thanks to his policy, no alternative forces to the former members of the Central Rada and the army of the UNR appeared in the country.

He states that this will reflect the aspirations of the entire Ukrainian people. Failure to do so threatens the accumulation of discontent.

From all fronts, fleets, garrisons and districts of not only Ukraine but also the whole Russian empire more than 700 delegates gathered for it. The Congress discussed the reorganization of the army on a national-territorial basis, the formation of the Ukrainian national army, and the demand for "Ukrainianization" of the Black Sea Fleet and some ships of the Baltic Fleet. Also a majority of the delegates expressed agreement with the decisions of the national congress and proclaimed support for the Central Rada. The congress discussed the military doctrine of Ukrainian autonomy. Most members of the Rada, including Hrushevsky and Vinnichenko, were in favor of maintaining the status quo. Ukraine in an alliance with Russia, in their opinion, would not need its own army, and a people's militia would suffice. Therefore, Ukrainianization should be supported in a limited way and an oragan should be created to influence this process in order to make it centralized. However, some military figures and a member of the Rada on the right, Mikhnovsky, expressed the need for a regular army for the future Ukraine for the protection of its interests. In this regard, they suggested that we should not limit ourselves to the creation of a military organization and support, but begin a targeted Ukrainization, under the leadership of the Central Rada."

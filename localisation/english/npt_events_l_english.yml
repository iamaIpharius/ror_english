 npt.political.54.d:0 "Politics and military force have always been intertwined in fascism. Simultaneously with the expansion of political influence, fascists began to create paramilitary organizations to defend themselves against both external and internal threats, the latter of which they refer to their political opponents. This development worries many, but in the wake of the militarist upsurge more and more volunteers are joining our armed forces. \n\nThe political leaders of the movement have shown that their opponents are not wary of them for nothing. When the army becomes politicized at every level, the enemies of the state [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism begin to look very similar."

 FIN_ROR.2.d: "Recently the Schutzkorps (Finnish Security Corps ) under Captain Fabricius landed on the Alands and quickly disarmed both individual Russian units and several garrisons of the coastal fortifications. From Stockholm the Finns' chartered steamship Heero with volunteers, arms and ammunition left for Åland. However, at the very beginning of the journey, the steamer was stopped by the Swedish authorities, as the Swedish government decided to send its own expeditionary corps to the Åland Islands "to stop the violence against the inhabitants. On February 15, three Swedish warships anchored near Eckero. A Swedish officer went ashore to persuade both warring parties to leave the Åland Islands. It turned out that by this time a truce had been concluded between the Schutzkor and the Russian troops to exchange prisoners of war; in view of the new circumstances the truce was extended. Soon the White Finns received word that the ice-breaker Murtaja with Red Guardsmen on board was headed from Turku toward the islands. Captain Fabritzius thought the agreement was broken and on February 17 the Schutzkorps attacked the garrison in Godby, forcing the Russian unit to lay down their arms. On February 19 the Schutzkorians succeeded in repulsing an attack by the Red Guards and Russian units arriving from Turku. These events were considered in Stockholm as an aggression against the population of Aland Islands and began to exert strong pressure on the Schutzkorps. Not having contacts with the Stavka, Captain Fabritius, having received false information from the Swedes, signed a "cooperation agreement", according to which the Schutzkorps had to surrender all weapons to the Swedes, leave the Åland Islands, travel by Swedish ships to Stockholm and return to Finland via Haparanda, where the Schutzkorps could get their weapons back. The Russians were also to leave the Åland Islands, but had 5 weeks to do so, with the opportunity to move their military stores to Turku. Now we have to choose how to proceed."

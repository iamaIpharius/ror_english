   rcw_rss_eva.1.desc:0 "After the establishment of the Directory, Atamans Volkov and Krasilnikov, realized that power in the liberated territories was flowing smoothly into the hands of the Socialists, and began to prepare forces for a right-wing coup. The Socialists worked faster, while the Whites had to go underground. But even here the atamans did not lose their spirits. From the taiga they brought out a new army, which was joined by many more rebel units. The rebels are in fact united by the common goal of overthrowing the red power, but the army has no unity of command. \n\nIn this background, several other famous generals moved into the rebel camp, whose names, though limited, can serve as banners for the entire movement.

 China.1.d:0 "After the death of Yuan Shikai, Li Yuanhong became president of the republic and Duan Qijui became prime minister. The Provisional Constitution was restored and parliament convened.nThe government had long been in dispute between supporters of the president and the prime minister, and their biggest conflict was the possibility of China entering World War I as a result of Germany's violation of the Hague Conventions.nThe situation in the government was reaching a boiling point, and it had to be decided whether China would enter the war.

 FRA_ministerial_leapfrog_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the war, the situation in the country has been difficult: due to the inability of each successive government to handle both the burdens placed upon it and the consequences of the previous cabinet's actions. The spiral of "ineffective governments" spirals, resulting in the frequent resignation of ministers about once every six months, which only exacerbates the situation, and any attempts to stabilize the situation in the cabinet have so far been in vain. It has come to the point where government buildings have no time to change the portrait of the current head of government."

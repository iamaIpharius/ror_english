 rcw_czechs.1.t:0 "The Czechoslovak National Soviet creates a branch in Russia"
 rcw_czechs.1.desc:0 "The Czech National Committee, settled in Paris, declared itself an organ of the liberation struggle of the Czech people against the Habsburg dynasty. In this struggle, the leaders of the committee intend to win independence, based on Slavic brotherhood and republican principles. But the committee does not have enough independent troops (most Czechs are drafted into the Austrian army), so the Parisian emigrants do not lose hope of using the Czechoslovak Rifle Brigade deployed in Russia. They also intend to recruit compatriots who have been taken prisoner in Russia. Until recently, the Czechoslovakian brigade proved to be excellent at the front - its fighters are ideological enemies of the Habsburgs. Now we can allow the committee to expand the brigade by trusting it and in a few months we will have excellent units at our disposal, perhaps a division or even a corps. Well a corps is unlikely."
 rcw_czechs.1.a:0 "Republic in Bohemia? We have our own plans."
 rcw_czechs.1.b:0 "We will provide everything the Slavic brothers need."
 
 rcw_czechs.3.t:0 "The Czechoslovak Corps is formed."
 rcw_czechs.3.desc:0 "After a long period of fruitful work by the Czech committees in Russia, solid reinforcements for the Czechoslovak brigade were recruited from among the prisoners of war of compatriots and emigrants. Gradually the incoming recruits made it possible to develop the brigade into two divisions, the first and the second Hussite division. At the same time individual regiments of the Czech brigade were present at the front and took part in real battles. Now a corps of two divisions is at our disposal."
 rcw_czechs.3.a:0 "Let's send them to storm Vienna."
 rcw_czechs.3.t_1:0 "Arrival of Czech corps from Russia."
 rcw_czechs.3.desc_1:0 "The brave Czech divisions, once established under the patronage of the Russian army, are now at our disposal."
 rcw_czechs.3.a_1:0 "Hail the patriots of Czechoslovakia!"
 
 rcw_czechs.4.t:0 "Situation of the Czechoslovak Corps."
 rcw_czechs.4.desc:0 "Since the deployment of the Czechoslovak Brigade into the corps, the situation in Russia has had time to change several times. The Czechs see this and understand how unstable their position here is. Meanwhile, the Western Allies offer to transfer the corps to their front, where Czechs will receive everything they need and can take part in the defeat of the German empires. It could be suggested that the Czechs continue to serve with us if the government intends to continue fighting, or we should think about evacuating them. Especially since they have already received weapons."
 rcw_czechs.4.a:0 "The war is not over. Let's convince the Czechs to stay here."
 rcw_czechs.4.b:0 "Let the Entente take care of the Czechs."
 
 rcw_czechs.5.t:0 "Corps Evacuation Route"
 rcw_czechs.5.desc:0 "The Czech legionnaires have several ways to leave Russia. However, it is worth bearing in mind that our roads are congested as it is, and undesirable incidents may occur on the way. In addition, the city where they will reach before they are sent west by sea must be ready to meet and accommodate this forty-thousand-strong army."
 rcw_czechs_5_tt_north:0 "From the northern ports the Entente cargoes come to us. This route for British ships is well known. It is also known how firmly it can freeze, and how weak the capacity of the northern railroads is. Under the Czar, most of the supplies simply did not have time to be shipped out and they were embedded in the land of the port cities. Now we must realize that concentrating the corps at a stone's throw from the center of Russia might not be desirable if relations with Entente deteriorate."
 rcw_czechs_5_tt_south:0 "In view of recent events on the Black Sea, an opportunity opens up to get the Czechs out by the fastest route, through the southern ports. The problem is that for our government, these regions are now a "gray zone". There are reports that a new insurgency is being prepared there, and it would be foolish to place a foreign military corps right in the middle of it."
 rcw_czechs_5_tt_east:0 "It seems safest to send the Czechs to Vladivostok. It is a very long and extremely long route, but stretching into a thin string of echelons all over Siberia the legionnaires would hardly pose a problem, even if they wanted to. We would have enough troops in each city to stop any misunderstanding. From Vladivostok itself the Czechs can also be released in batches, without allowing them to gather together at one point."
 rcw_czechs_5_tt_UKR:0 "As a last resort, the Czechs can be turned over to the Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine has both its own front with Germany and access to the Black Sea."
 rcw_czechs_5_tt_no_direction:0 "...however, we have nowhere to send them. If you see this message, please report the error to https://vk.com/ror_civilwar."

 rcw_czechs.5.e:0 "Unfortunately, you cannot be taken out. I ask you to take it with understanding."
 
 rcw_czechs.6.t:0 "Ships for the Czech Corps."
 rcw_czechs.6.desc:0 "The Czech Legionnaires in full arrived at the port from which they are ordered to evacuate to the west. However, an unexpected problem arose in providing ships to transport the Czechs by sea. We can provide our own or wait for the Entente to take care of the matter."
 rcw_czechs.6.a:0 "Provide whatever is necessary."
 rcw_czechs.6.b:0 "Inform the Allies of the problem."
 
 rcw_czechs.7.t:0 "Problems with the evacuation of the Czech Corps"
 rcw_czechs.7.desc:0 "A Czech corps formed in Russia is to arrive on the western front. The Russians refused to maintain it and turned over all leadership over it to the Entente. Now the Czechs are stationed in a Russian port city and cannot leave it because of the small number of ships, suitable for the transport of troops. We are asked to provide our convoys for the duration of the evacuation."
 rcw_czechs.7.a:0 "Now we need convoys ourselves."
 rcw_czechs.7.b:0 "All right, send ships."
 
 rcw_czechs.8.t:0 "Czechs in Ukraine"
 rcw_czechs.8.desc:0 "The Russian authorities transferred the Czechoslovak Rifle Corps to our responsibility. This is a significant force on which the Entente countries are counting. More importantly, we, too, can count on the Czechs if we make an agreement with the Allies to keep the corps on the southwestern front."
 rcw_czechs.8.a:0 "We will take care of moving the Czechs west."
 rcw_czechs.8.b:0 "We'll try to negotiate."
 
 rcw_czechs.9.t:0 "Ukraine asks to keep the Czech Corps"
 rcw_czechs.9.desc:0 "The Czech corps was formed in Russia, but it became difficult for the Russians to maintain it. According to an agreement with us, the Czechs became part of the Entente armies and had to go by sea to our front, after which the Russians transported them to the Ukraine. Now the Ukrainian command wants to negotiate about leaving the corps on their land for the sake of preserving the Eastern anti-German front. Transporting the Czechs would be very costly and, all things considered, they could help the Ukrainian army for a while."
 rcw_czechs.9.a:0 "We agree with the Ukrainian proposal."
 rcw_czechs.9.b:0 "This is unacceptable."
 
 rcw_czechs.10.t:0 "Entente refusal"
 rcw_czechs.10.desc:0 "[From.GetName] does not give permission to keep the Czech Corps, and that their ships themselves will take the Czechoslovaks to the Western Front."
 rcw_czechs.10.a:0 "Wonderful."
 
 rcw_czechs.13.t:0 "Clashes between the Czechs and the Internationalists."
 rcw_czechs.13.desc:0 "Recently we began creating internationalist units from former captive Austrian and German soldiers. Most of them were in Siberian camps and are now being taken to central Russia. At the same time, the railroads are loaded with trains evacuating the Czechoslovak Corps. Random encounters between Hungarian and German interbrigadists and Czechs have more than once escalated into clashes. The Czechs are armed, they make no secret of their dislike for our new comrades and take every opportunity to humiliate them."
 rcw_czechs.13.a:0 "Make sure this does not happen again."
 
 rcw_czechs.14.t:0 "Czechs do not obey."
 rcw_czechs.14.desc:0 "During the last period, the cases of violations of the orders of the local authorities by the evacuated Czechs became more frequent. With rifles, grenades and machine guns, Czechs feel they have the right to dispose of all spheres of their life independently. On several occasions the situation escalated to the point that the Czechs were ordered to surrender their weapons, and of course they did not comply. Meanwhile we have an order in the corps specifying that in each echelon there should be only one armed company with 300 pieces of ammunition per rifle, and that all the armaments above that were to be handed over back in Penza. The Czechs did not carry out this order."
 rcw_czechs.14.a:0 "Every Czechoslovak found armed on the railroad line must be shot."
 rcw_czechs.14.b:0 "Our forces are too weak to act decisively."
 
 rcw_czechs.15.t:0 "Mutiny of the Czechoslovak Corps"
 rcw_czechs.15.desc:0 "Outraged at the necessity of surrendering their surplus arms and complying with the regulations laid down by our government, the Czechoslovak Legionnaires began a coordinated action. It is not yet clear whether their purpose is to overturn Russia or to obtain a lasting corridor for evacuation from it. Nor is it possible to say whether the Entente is coordinating the actions of the Czechs, and what their relations are with political circles hostile to our government. The fact is that the internal enemies, having learned of the Czech adventure, hastened to start their own insurrections. As a consequence, chaos reigns on the railroads."
 SOV_czechs_uprising_position_1_1_tt:0 "According to the latest information, the forces of the Czechoslovak corps are stretched from Penza to Vologda.

This group surrendered after two hours of fighting with rifles, machine guns and hand grenades. No exact casualty figures are available yet, but it appears that no more than 15 men were killed and about 40 wounded. The Japanese and British have landed large armed landing parties in the town, but they did not take part in the fighting. Admiral Knight tonight landed a small unit of sailors for the sole purpose of protecting the consulate. At the request of the Czechs, Japanese and British patrols were withdrawn everywhere except the consulates, and the Czechs themselves took to the streets, which saved the city from annexation by foreign interventionists, but resulted in the final establishment of white power in the city, friendly to the interventionists and hostile to the workers' and peasants' government."

Now the waiting was over: while [Root.GetRulingParty] was preparing with the army to suppress the popular uprising, [Root.GetAdjective] was placed under house arrest by several members of the government, after which they began negotiations with the rebels. \nUnThese negotiations were conducted under the pretext of maintaining public order, but in reality their task was to distribute positions in the new socialist state to those who were willing to cooperate. The coup took place swiftly, and anyone who might have opposed the new regime was executed, arrested, or sent into exile."
 political.3.a:0 "The waves of history wash away the past."
 political.4.t:0 "[Root.GetName] is experiencing class conflict."
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, previously supported only by marginal intellectuals and desperate rebels, has suddenly begun to gain popularity among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The very fact that more and more people are willing to classify themselves as a "class" shows that Marxist ideas have not only spread among those who actively seek to overthrow the government. \n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] laments this reversal of public opinion and bemoans the times when the word "[Root.GetAdjective]" was important to people. It seems that a revolution is already taking place in society on various levels, and there is no way to stop the process."

 political.6.d:0 "Increasingly widespread in the state [Root.GetName] is the notion that the Communist movement meets the aspirations of the people, and support for the Communists has grown significantly in recent months. But those now calling for revolution are no longer just militants or disgruntled union members. The movement is led by a group organized enough to form a government if the coup succeeds. \n\nbut if the revolution starts now, it is likely that the state [Root.GetName] will be plunged into civil war.

They believe that the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten the importance of military force for the preservation of power. Many are annoyed by the treatment of the military as a tool rather than as one of the pillars of the state. Some even claim that the state [Root.GetName] needs a new government to move steadily into the second half of the century. \nIn this faction there are not many politicians, but there are officials from the Ministry of Defense. They could gain enough political weight to stage a coup if events continue to develop in this vein."

 political.9.t:0 "Fascist coup."
 political.9.d:0 "Some claim they saw it coming. Both those who warned of the threat and those who called for fascism to save the state [Root.GetName] have seen their prophecies fulfilled today: the military in the city [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the government formed by the [Root.GetRulingParty] and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] disappeared and is rumored to have fled the country, so there was no resistance to the conspirators.{n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] government is not going to give the discontented a chance to prove themselves somehow.

Some are calling for an immediate coup before the weakness of the [Root.GetName] state is exploited by enemies.

 political.11.t:0 "Fascists form assault divisions."
 political.11.d:0 "Politics and military force have always been intertwined in fascism. Simultaneously with the expansion of political influence, fascists began to create paramilitary organizations to defend themselves against both external and internal threats, the latter of which they refer to their political opponents. This development worries many, but in the wake of the militarist upsurge more and more volunteers are joining our armed forces. \n\nThe political leaders of the movement have shown that their opponents are not wary of them for nothing. When the army becomes politicized at every level, the enemies of the state [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism begin to look very similar."

And what protection can [Root.GetRulingParty] give us?"\n\n[Root.GetName] is experiencing a growing fascist movement because of the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates, who at other times would have rejected fascism as well as any other inappropriate experimentation with ideology, are now concerned.

So far, organized protests and pamphlets have been prevalent mainly at universities or in poor areas of the state [Root.GetName], but the movement is spreading, of that there is no doubt. \n\nThe opinion of the nation's leaders is divided.

Nevertheless, the public increasingly supports it. Fascists call the leader [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, because you cannot claim to express the will of the people and not hear their voices. \n\nThe call for a referendum has so far been dismissed as a typical attempt by party members [Root.GetRulingParty] to break the system, but it is at least a political measure.

This anonymous letter, published in all the major Newspapers, caused a sensation. It was supposedly written on behalf of a conscript who at first dodged the draft, but then realized that he had to save his country, and it obviously touched a nerve of those who had similar doubts.

In view of the seriousness of the situation, the War Ministry decided to try them according to the laws of war. A series of death sentences were issued, which were carried out by firing squads.

Reports of their deaths were edited to put them in the most favorable light. Mass demonstrations began in large cities demanding an end to the war.

He also spoke of an affordable housing program for young families that would begin on the first day after the signing of the armistice. The speech seems to have had a big impact on the public mood. Reports are coming in from recruiting offices across the country that more and more recruits are asking for an extension of their service beyond the current military conflict, and others are demanding that they be transferred to the front lines to receive additional benefits."

Attempts to clear the roads were actively resisted by the workers, who threw stones and bottles at the soldiers. \nIn some cases, the squads fired in self-defense, killing some strikers and injuring more. This only enraged the crowd and bystanders, who began shouting "Murderers!" Public opinion in the capital quickly sided with the strikers.

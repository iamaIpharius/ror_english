 treaty_of_brest.2.t_1:0 "Proposal of the Russian Government".
 treaty_of_brest.2.d:0 "The Bolshevik Russian Government, in pursuance of the decree on peace, has proposed to us to open negotiations for an immediate democratic peace without annexations or contributions, which desire we declared in 1916, and is an excellent opportunity for getting the Russians out of the war. We can make peace right now, showing the seriousness of our intentions, or we can take advantage of the situation in Russia and separate the outskirts from it, which will show the Entente countries the falseness of our declarations..."
 Treaty_of_brest.2.d_1:0 "Against the background of the political crisis, the Russian government has decided to request a temporary truce and to begin separate negotiations for peace.

 treaty_of_brest.6.t:0 "First stage of negotiations"
 treaty_of_brest.6.d:0 "In accordance with the peace decree we have adopted, our delegation is seeking the most democratic peace possible with minimum concessions on both sides, but these efforts may go awry because of opposition in the Central Committee. The appetites of the Germans turned out to be, for many, surprisingly moderate - Lithuania, Poland, Courland, that is, the territories occupied by them during the campaign of 1915. And the territories occupied by the German troops have their puppet governments, and in order to respect the right of peoples to self-determination after the withdrawal of troops of all warring parties, a referendum should be held there to confirm the independence. It is obvious that the German side will not make concessions so easily, because they have already clearly expressed their intention to keep these territories. They disguise their demands with statements of support for local national governments, but they have no intention of withdrawing their troops from there."
 treaty_of_brest.6.d_1:0 "The appetites of the Germans were, for many, surprisingly moderate - Lithuania, Poland, Courland, that is, the territories occupied by them during the campaign of 1915. Of course, they disguise their demands under the statements of support of the local national governments, but they do not intend to withdraw their troops from there. In order to respect the right of peoples to self-determination, we can propose the withdrawal of troops from these territories, after which a referendum will be held to confirm their independence, making it very difficult for the Germans to control these territories."
 treaty_of_brest.6.a:0 "It will be a miracle if they accept the proposal without amendment..."
 treaty_of_brest.7.t:0 "Another proposal from the Russians."
 treaty_of_brest.7.d:0 "The Russian government proposes that both sides withdraw troops from the territories of Lithuania, Courland and Poland in order to hold a referendum there to confirm the independence of the governments established there. Of course, the Russians should take note of the statements expressing the will of the peoples inhabiting Poland, Lithuania, Courland, and parts of Livonia about their desire for full state independence and for secession from the state [RUS.GetNameDef], that these statements under the present conditions should be considered as expressions of the popular will, that is, there is no need for referenda, so the withdrawal of our troops is unnecessary."

 treaty_of_brest.7.b:0 "The terms of the Russians suit us fine".
 treaty_of_brest.8.t:0 "Peace".
 treaty_of_brest.8.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to our proposal and will soon begin withdrawing troops from all the territories they occupy. The ease with which they accepted this offer is disconcerting, although it is possible that they only feared a delay in negotiations on our part, which would doubtless increase revolutionary sentiment in Germany itself. In any case, peace was achieved, which can be considered a gigantic victory for our diplomacy."
 treaty_of_brest.8.a:0 "Excellent."

The present congress is being opened by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee as an emergency congress because of the extraordinary circumstances experienced by our country. This Congress must give final resolution to the question, previously decided by the Central Executive Committee, of the adoption and ratification of the peace treaty with Germany. Such an important question can only be decided by the highest organ of Soviet power, and not as the Central Committee of the Party. Surprisingly, in these difficult conditions, the extraordinary congress turned out to be very numerous, and we can all only rejoice that deputies from all over Russia have come here, that this most important question will be decided by an assembly of true representatives of the working and peasant masses, which will leave no doubt about the legitimacy of the decisions made by it. Though not everyone could make it, we could find out from the random telegrams that the local Soviets warmly welcome the congress, that they are separated from us by hundreds of miles, but they are with us in mind and heart. Recollections of our recent revolutionary struggle against the forces of reaction should give the deputies pep in their hearts. It was not as easy to tear down the banner of revolution as our opponents thought. Although the deputies of the Congress are mainly in favor of peace, the telegrams received from the places mostly contain a call to support the revolutionary war and not to accept peace with annexations and contributions: Arkhangelsk, Samara, Saratov, Bryansk,Nikolaev, Ekaterinoslav, Ryazan, Kursk, Kazan, Khabarovsk, Ufa, Tobolsk and others.

 RIF_ROR.4.d: "The Spanish-French-Moroccan War of 1921-1926 - the colonial war of Spain and France against the Berber Emirate of Rif, created as a result of the uprising in Northern Morocco. The main event is the Battle of Anval, in which the Reef troops inflicted a heavy defeat on the Spaniards, holding the military initiative for the first years. It ended with the elimination of the Emirate of Rif after a joint offensive by Spanish and French troops. Resistance to the Spaniards from local residents, primarily Berbers, began almost immediately after the entry of Spanish troops into northern Morocco. The first hotbed of resistance was the vicinity of Melilla, where Mohammed el Mizan rebelled even before the official signing of an agreement between France and Spain on the partition of Morocco; this uprising was not widespread and was suppressed after a few months. When the real Spanish occupation of the territory began to expand, a new, larger uprising took place - this time in Jabal, the region from the coast of the Atlantic Ocean to the foothills of the Reef, which also includes the administrative center of the protectorate - the city of Tetuan, led by Ahmed al-Rasul, who controls the city Asilah and part of the west coast of the country; The uprising led by this pirate and partisan leader, famous for kidnapping Europeans with a ransom demand, was finally suppressed only in 1921, and even then only because al-Rasul eventually simply sided with the Spaniards. If you want to play for the Rif (with your tricks), then write in the command line tag RIF."

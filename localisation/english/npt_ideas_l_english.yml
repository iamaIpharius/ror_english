 RUS_peasant_and_land_and_bread_question_desc:0 "The development of capitalist relations in the Russian countryside was much slower than in Europe. The abolition of serfdom in 1861 failed to solve the problem because of high redemption fees and credit obligations imposed on peasants; farms could not develop because the community became more and more united, preventing the concentration of capital. \nAfter the 1905 revolution, redemption fees were abolished, and in 1906, Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin launched his agrarian reform, which was aimed at destroying peasant communities, accelerating the development of capitalism in the village and eliminating zapotism - the mixing of land plots of different peasants and other peasants, which was a result of land distribution by the community. Despite the weakening of the community, the land issue has not yet been solved, and the vast majority of peasants still lead a subsistence economy. Social tensions are increasingly undermining the situation in the country."

It does not allow modernization and reduces the efficiency of farming. This problem has existed since the time of Alexander II and was shat on up to Stolypin.\n At present, a large part of the peasants lead a subsistence economy and do not produce marketable bread. Social tension among the peasants is quite high.

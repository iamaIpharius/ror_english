But those have been found who have tried to set us against each other, and we have taken up arms to defend our vital values against the encroachments of the socialists. But behind this we failed to see the greatest threat that came from within.nThe shadow of liberalism hung over us, thanks to the efforts of industrialists and some Dumas, who put their own man in charge of the enemy's army. They hoped to plunge Russia into the abyss. But the hatred in their hearts could not hide forever. In the end, the day came when our enemies showed their true face.nLiberals hoped to destroy the Empire, traitorously killing the head of state and taking control of the RIA. But in the way of these failed tyrants valiantly stood those in whose hands the German stamps were not laid. Our faithful soldiers curbed the insurrectionists in Petrograd and suppressed riots in dozens of cities. \nThe surviving socialists and liberals will be found and destroyed. Any of their accomplices would meet a similar fate. We have lived in a time of trial and we have survived it with flying colors.n The attempt on my life has left scars on my body, but I assure you, my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Socialists have been defeated and the Duma rebellion has been crushed. We are on the threshold of a new life. To guarantee our security and stability, we will reform the Empire on pre-October principles, into a solid and secure community which, I can assure you, will last for ten thousand years. We will create an Empire with this august assembly still at its head, and a sovereign ruler ruling for life. We will create an empire which will obey the opinion of the majority, an empire which will live according to God's laws. \now that all places in Russia will have a single law, a single language, a single enlightened ruler, there will be no more place for the corruption which corrupted the foundations of the former empire, and the governors-general will make sure that no second insurrection will arise anywhere else. A strong, growing army will ensure that the laws are obeyed every day.nThe new Imperial Order will protect our most important values in life. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will not yield to the enemy, we will meet him together, whether he comes from within or from without. Let the enemy know: the Empire will crush anyone who encroaches on its well-being. We have put on our shoulders a difficult task, but the peoples of the Empire are ready for the test. Thanks to our efforts, Russia has traded civil war for peace, and anarchy for stability. The gazes of millions of living beings now look forward to a future in which everyone can feel safe. Citizens of the Empire must also do their part. Become the eyes and ears of the Empire, reporting on potential rebels. Go to the far corners of Russia and instill the principles of autocracy in the foreigners. To erect monuments and marvels of technology that will tell future generations of our glory. The White Guard fighters, who will henceforth bear the proud name of imperial percussionists, coped with the incredibly dangerous task of defeating our enemies on the front lines. Many of them died for the glory of the Empire. In the minds of the people of the Empire this example of extraordinary valor should be imprinted forever.nThe new order has triumphed over a secretive community of nefarious businessmen. Our future course is clear. With me at the helm, the Empire will achieve greatness beyond measure. We have passed the test, only becoming stronger. We will continue our march forward as one people - as subjects of the Russian Empire. We will triumph. From this day begins ten thousand years of peace."

 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.0.desc:0 "Today, January 9, on the regular anniversary of the shooting of the workers' demonstration in 1905, in a number of industrial cities of the country, once again disgruntled citizens, incited by socialist provocateurs, came out to rallies and demonstrations. \nOn that fateful day for the autocracy everything got out of hand, over 130 people were killed and the revolution started which resulted in a number of riots across the country and the creation of local "Soviet republics", which forced us to use the army to suppress the riots, but our experience with "revolutionaries" does not allow us to make such mistakes anymore. Without the leaders sitting in jail and exile back in 1912, the protest went on peacefully and without incident. Except that the raging crowd in Moscow, where about two thousand people gathered on Tverskoi Boulevard, and up to 30 thousand workers did not go to work, was pacified with rifles. And in Petrograd, according to various sources, a number of demonstrations gathered up to 100 thousand people, which, however, reported the Social-Democratic newspapers, which should not be believed, in addition, they ended. It is difficult not to believe the truth, given the fact that even the garrison of the city does not have enough living space, not to mention the workers, who are cut off not a room, but a quarter of a room. These are solvable problems, though."

In July, 1915 the 1st congress of Military-Industrial Committee was held. In August of the same year the legal act assigning the committees functions of assistance to government institutions in supplying the army and navy with necessary equipment and provisioning by means of planned distribution of raw materials and orders, their timely implementation and price fixing was approved. In November 1915, elected representatives of workers began to appear under the committees. These workers' representatives formed Workers' groups, which were already socialist opposition bodies and were formally called to settle conflicts between workers and entrepreneurs, but in fact they carried out subversive activities.\n On the anniversary of the "Bloody Sunday" on January 9, 1917, the Working Group of the CPC supported the organization of a general strike, and at the current date our agents report that a new anti-government demonstration will be organized from one day to another, which will be held at the same place.

 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.3.desc:0 "The crisis situation in grain procurements and transport, which had worsened by the end of 1916, demanded action. December 2, 1916 "Special Conference on Food" imposed Prodrazverstka, but despite the harsh measures, instead of the planned 772.1 million poods of bread to the state reserves could collect only 170 million poods. As a result, in December 1916 the norms for soldiers at the front were reduced from 3 to 2 pounds per day, and in the front-line zone - to 1.5 pounds. Bread ration cards were introduced in Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, Chernigov, Podolsk, Voronezh, Ivanovo-Voznesensk and other cities.Rumors about introduction of ration cards already in Petrograd were not groundless, according to the statistics department for December 1916 St. Petersburg and Moscow districts did not receive 61 % of the planned quantity of bread, 80 % of this undelivery was due to lack of cargo and only 10 % - to failure to supply wagons. During 1916 the average monthly consumption of flour in Petrograd was 1,276,000 poods. Supply disruptions began in November, when 1,171,000 poods were delivered to the capital. In December the supply dropped to 606,000 poods, in January 1917 only 731,000 poods were delivered. \nThe bread crisis had its logical development in the bread riots. According to the newspaper "Birzhevye Vedomosti" yesterday on the Petrograd side began the destruction of bakeries and dairy shops, then continued throughout the city. The crowd surrounded the bakeries and bakeries and with shouts of "Bread, bread" moved through the streets. "

Workers at the Torshilov weaving factory and the Old Parviainen shell factory halted production. Participants in the joint rally from the Vyborg embankment headed for the center of Petrograd. On Lesny Prospect, they met a 3,000-strong demonstration of the workers of the "New Parviainen" plant and together with them marched to the center of the city over the Liteiny Bridge. The plants "Old Lessner", "New Lessner", "Ayvaz", "Erikson", "Russian Renault", "Rosencrantz", "Phoenix", "Promet" and others stopped working. By evening workers of Vyborg and Petrograd sides (via Liteiny prospect), Rozhdestvensky and Alexandrovsky districts (from Znamenskaya square), Putilovsky plant and Narva district (to Kazansky cathedral) came to Nevsky Prospect. In total 128 thousand people went on strike. Columns of demonstrators marched with slogans like "Down with war!", "Down with autocracy!", "Bread!".According to the reports of Okhrana department, in Korpusnaya street workers seriously beat policeman Vashev, in Nizhegorodskaya street collegiate secretary Grotius was beaten.nIn today, there were several clashes of demonstrators with the police. During the riots we observed (as a general phenomenon) an extremely defiant attitude of the rioters towards the military detachments, who were attacked by the crowd with stones and clumps of snow, chipped from the streets in response to their offers to disperse. Not only did the crowd not disperse when the troops fired upwards, but such volleys were met with laughter. Only when live ammunition was fired into the thick of the crowd, it was possible to disperse the crowds, most of whom, however, hid in the yards of nearby houses and when the shooting stopped, came back out into the street. The movement erupted spontaneously, without preparation, and solely on the basis of the food crisis. Since the military units did not hinder the crowd, and in some cases even took measures to paralyze the actions of the police officials, the masses gained confidence in their impunity, and now, after two days of unhindered walking through the streets, when the revolutionary circles advanced the slogans "down with the war" and "down with the government", - the people have become convinced of the idea that the revolution has begun, that success lies with the masses, that the authorities are powerless to suppress the movement in virtue of the fact that the military units will come out openly on the side of the revolutionary forces not today or tomorrow, that the movement that has begun will no longer subside, but will grow without interruption until the final victory and coup d'etat.

 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.16.desc:0 "Before the war in 1910, a special commission at the General Staff Headquarters ascertained the existence of an excess stock of old 810,000 serviceable berdankas with 275 million reliable cartridges. It came to the conclusion that because of previous rearmament on three-line guns Berdankas were simply cluttering the warehouses, so it was decided to put them under the knife: "if we provide necessary units of militia with Berdankas, there would be about 400 000 berdankas in surplus, that the current work in our gun factories increases the number of 3-lin. rifles and in case of war we could produce up to 2000 rifles a day, that the said 400 000 Berdankas needlessly clutters already overloaded warehouses". That is why Berdankas were sold to the population or used as scrap.n The same year 339 000 rifles were withdrawn from wartime stocks. In 1912 General Polivanov said in the State Duma that "we have all the rifles. On the eve of the war they were even distributed among the allies. That is why since 1908 the armament factories, reducing the production of rifles, were forced to produce bowlers, spades and fuses. The cartridge factories in 1909-1910 did not work at full capacity, and in 1911, in order to avoid disbanding experienced workers, work was done only 5 days a week. In 1912, just two years before the war, the Sestroretsk gun factory was nearly shut down. The Tula factory, the largest in the country, in January 1914 produced only five rifles, in February - also five, in March - six, in April - five, in May - only one, in June - one, in July - one training rifle. The day before the war. Also the bureaucratic chaos and the distribution of military orders led to a significant underutilization of capacity, when some factories were idle while others were overstretched. The Obukhov plant from 1906 to 1915 did not receive orders for 76-mm, 107-mm and mountain guns, as well as 152-mm howitzers. The Putilov plant received an order for 200 howitzers only in May 1915 (almost a year had passed since the beginning of the war). Only one gun factory, the St. Petersburg one, was directly under the jurisdiction of the War Department. In addition, the pre-war attempts to build new artillery and shell factories, which were even considered unnecessary by some people, have been failed. This affected in 1914. The Russian army was hit by shell starvation, rifle starvation and gun starvation. The fact that skilled workers were drafted into the army, and it was considered impossible to bring them back because of the "depressing moral impression that such a return made on the comrades of these lower ranks who remained in the ranks" also had an effect. At the artillery factories with the first call about 30% of the available workers and servicemen at the time of the declaration of war left. The losses could still be replenished by the rich labor market, but with further drafts the shortage of workers, especially highly skilled ones, was getting worse and worse. Already by the declaration of war the Sestroretsk plant was left without blacksmiths. On July 5, 1915 a prominent industrialist Y. P. Guzhon noted that "there is no point in talking about increasing equipment and installing new machinery when even the existing machines are left without work for lack of labor."

 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.17.t:0 "The state of our supplies."
 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.17.desc:0 "As early as September 1914 the General Artillery Administration, convinced of the impossibility of satisfying the army's needs for rifles with its rifle factories, began a search abroad. It needed 1 million rifles at a time and 100 000 rifles per month (according to the August 1915 report of the War Ministry - at least 200 000 per month), while the Russian gun factories in August 1914 produced only 10296 rifles. Although it was possible to increase the production, but between July 1914 and November 1916 1,808,000 of the 3,727,000 rifles entered the army were imported, i. e. almost half of them. Situation with machine guns was quite sad - there was no production of them in Russia and still is.There are also white spots - with 3-mm guns situation is saved by so to say prestige of domestic industry - we had 94% of our guns (12 715 ours against 586 imported), but it is compensated by shortage of these very guns which is still in existence. Production covers about one fifth of marginal needs (although the situation of Turks or Austrians is many times worse). Heavy field artillery, on the other hand, is once again half imported, and the demand for it is not fully covered. Production of cartridges and shells in Russia now accounts for 60% and 75% respectively of the total supply, which is good, but up to 62% of gunpowder (separate from imported ammunition) was imported from abroad, mostly from the American company DuPont. \nThe supply situation was particularly aggravated by purely transportation problems - so in 1913 Russia had 19866 steam locomotives, 30673 passenger cars, 484250 freight cars and platforms. There was a shortage of at least 2,000 steam locomotives and 80,000 freight wagons. At the same time each infantry division required 35-45 echelons, and up to 128 for the army corps. Even if we do not take the situation of front-line areas, at the beginning of the war the narrow-gauge railway from Arkhangelsk could not cope with the removal of goods arriving from America, England and France, also interfered with the need to overload on a broad gauge. One train a day from Vladivostok to European Russia required about 100 locomotives and 3,000 wagons. Most of the locomotives ordered by Russo-Balt abroad either did not arrive in Russia in time, or lay in Arkhangelsk and Vladivostok for lack of transport. In 1916 the steam locomotive fleet decreased by 16% and freight cars by 14%. The re-gauge and the purchase of freight cars in the United States (12,268 cars and platforms in 1916) did not yield the desired result, although only the steamship Mogilev delivered 33,000 pieces of rails, 250 cars and 20 locomotives. This was due, among other things, to the varying quality of coal and the untrained nature of Russian machinists in dealing with American machinery. Also with the help of the British, the throughput capacity of the Arkhangelsk Railroad was raised to 240-250 cars per day by 1916, and doubled by the end of the year, but it is still not enough."

 russian_ovrthrw_of_mon.18.desc:0 "Finally, the condition of our soldiers themselves leaves much to be desired. There is no need to recall the well-known phenomenon of self-mutilators and "self-shooters" who did this to evade conscription - it was solved by the introduction of the death penalty for this. A more important problem was fraternization - in December 1914, on the day of Christmas Germans came out from their trenches against the positions of the Danube and Belebey regiments of the 1st army (the same army that took part in the East Prussian operation) and started waving white rags and came to the river, showing bottles and cigars and inviting Russian soldiers to their places. About 10-15 unarmed Germans came to the river, got into the boat, crossed to our side and began to lure to themselves the soldiers of the aforementioned regiments who came to the shore. Several people gave in to this sneaky trick and crossed to the German side, and most shamefully of all - Lieutenant Semen Stepanovich Svidersky-Malyarchuk, called from the reserve of the Danube Regiment, crossed with them. All our soldiers who crossed to the other side and this unworthy officer were immediately arrested by the Germans and taken prisoner. It is hard to call it a fraternization, as it was not of mass character and ended with arrest of the Germans who crossed over from the other side of the front. In 1916 this phenomenon became a mass one and a great importance in fraternizations was an extensive exchange of food and things, mainly bread and drinks. Bypassing Prohibition. All this leads to the fall of military discipline, and officers' attempts to suppress it by beatings, hardens soldiers more and more, and is likely to lead to further decline in discipline, until the death penalty begins. \now, speaking about the state of garrison units, specifically in Petrograd there are only 20 thousand places in the barracks for 160 thousand men, which affects their condition negatively. It is also necessary to take into account the composition of the army which has changed since 1914 - there are not many professional officers, especially in the infantry. New officers were quickly losing heart, they were bored with the war and were completely unable to raise and support their soldiers' spirits.n Though all these are trifles - the real alarming sign is refusal of some units of the 12th Army near Riga to lead the offensive. At first 13 soldiers of the mutineers were shot, then a total of about a hundred were shot."

The Soviets of Moscow and Petrograd were rapidly becoming Bolsheviks: up to 90% of the seats in the Petrosoviet are now held by the Bolsheviks, in Moscow and in 80 other large cities they now occupy a majority. The Soviets of the Baltic Fleet have also come under their control."

Only an insignificant faction of the SR remained. However, at the All-Russian trade union meeting which has recently taken place, it turned out that since the beginning of the revolution an explosive growth of the Bolsheviks' influence was observed. Balloting showed that they held about half the mandates of the delegates to the conference, and the lists of boards showed that the Bolsheviks had a considerable share in the central bureaus of the trade unions in Moscow, Petrograd, Ivano-Voznesensk, Kharkov, Kiev, Samara, and a sure predominance in the trade unions connected with heavy industry."

And already now it is possible to predict with confidence, that in Russia the democratic republic will triumph. The Russian people has full political freedom. They can now have their say in the internal self-determination of the country and its foreign policy. And addressing all the nations which have been destroyed and plundered in the monstrous war we declare that the time has come to start a decisive struggle against the usurped aspirations of all the governments. It is time for the people to take the question of war and peace into their own hands. \n\nOn this occasion we address ourselves to our proletarian brothers of the Austro-German coalition and, above all, to the German proletariat. From the first days of the war you have been persuaded that, by raising arms against autocratic Russia, you are defending the culture of Europe against Asian despotism. Many of you saw this as justification for the support you gave to the war. This justification is no more: a democratic Russia cannot be a threat to liberty and civilization. We will steadfastly defend our own freedom against all kinds of reactionary encroachments, both from within and from without. \n\nThe Russian revolution will not retreat before the bayonets of the conquerors and will not allow itself to be crushed by external military force. But we appeal to you: throw off the yoke of your autocratic order, just as the Russian people shook off the tsarist autocracy; refuse to serve as an instrument of seizure and violence in the hands of kings, landlords and bankers - and with joint efforts we will stop the terrible slaughter, which disgraces humanity and overshadows the great days of Russian freedom. \nWorkers of all countries! Brotherly and fraternally extending our hand over the mountains of brotherly corpses, over the rivers of innocent blood and tears, over the smoking ruins of cities and villages, over the lost treasures of culture, we call upon you to restore and strengthen international unity. Therein lies the pledge of our coming victories and the complete liberation of mankind."

Milyukov, mailing the text of the government statement to the governments of the Entente countries, attached his transmittal note. In it he said that the position of the Provisional Government gave no reason to think about weakening the role of Russia in the allied struggle and proclaimed the popular desire to bring the World War to a victorious end. Four days later the Provisional Government informed the Allied ambassadors that, after discussion, Milyukov's note had been unanimously accepted by the cabinet."

 russia.26.desc:0 "In the first week Kerensky was successful in his negotiations, the government was forming, the illusion of being able to salvage the rosy dream of a stable coalition government persisted. The results of Kerensky's negotiations with the Kd party were codified in seven points, the meaning of which was to preserve the status quo and irreconcilability with regard to the parties' pushing of their programs until the Constituent Assembly. The government's sole aim was to safeguard the gains of the revolution, and therefore the implementation of all basic reforms and the resolution of questions about the form of the state system should be postponed until the Constituent Assembly. The program was declared to be non-partisan and nationwide, as it established only the general conditions of any "cultural" statehood.The guarantee of the fulfillment of this program was to be the correct composition of the government, which would include representatives of the bourgeoisie to compensate the socialists. The question of Chernov's resignation was raised, but Kerensky disagreed with such a demand of the Cadets. In turn, the Cadets V. D. Nabokov,N. I. Astrov and F. F. Kokoshkin refused to enter the cabinet while Chernov remained in it, but the Central Committee of the Cadet Party decided not to insist on his resignation, if in general their requirements for the formation of the cabinet would be met. And negotiations were suspended, but after a few days it turned out that I. G. Cereteli did not quite agree with this program, and said that in view of the exceptional seriousness of the situation of the country, the government wished to attract new persons from circles which would be willing to stand on the ground of the latest, socialist government declaration. It was stated that "all the rumors about the crisis of the Provisional Government and the possibility of revising its program are totally untrue. Tsereteli added that "this is the opinion of the whole government", if we take into account only those who remained in this government, and therefore, negotiations could only be conducted within the framework of this program. Tsereteli's ultimatum was essentially a refusal to continue negotiations, and he himself additionally backed up his demand by the threat of his resignation. Although it is clear that Tsereteli's ultimatum was intended to give up power and regain his freedom to criticize the bourgeois government and regain influence in the Soviets, rather than to take power and hold himself responsible for his actions. Negotiations are on the verge of collapse, and the question is what to do?"

The [party statement of the Kadets] cannot serve as an obstacle to the inclusion in the Provisional Government [of the Socialists]." However, the statement was not an obstacle to entry, provided the program laid down in it was carried out. But Kerensky declared that the new government "in its activities will always be guided by those provisions which are set forth in its declarations...", thus de facto accepting Tsereteli's ultimatum. The program accepted by the government was unacceptable for the Kadets, which is why the Kadets would not join the government. However, taking advantage of the crisis and unpleasant rumors about him, Chernov still resigned from the government on his own initiative. He motivated his resignation by a desire to regain "full freedom of action as a private person defending his political honor and pursuing detractors", because because of his activities during the emigration he was accused of working for the German intelligence for the defeatist propaganda among the Russian prisoners of war in the past. Initially this did not affect the decision of the C.S.D. Party, but further the Central Committee rescinded the declaration of non-participation in the government and moved to Petrograd. Kerensky received urgent requests from the Social Revolutionary Party comrades to review the case of Chernov in the Ministry of Justice in the most urgent manner and rehabilitate the "village" minister. Kerensky told the government that due to insurmountable difficulties in creating a new government on the only right basis, he returned the authority given to him to form the cabinet and resigned his title of cabinet member and Minister-President.

Kerensky is confused. Prior to this, he did not want to make steps to the left as well as to the right. The main obstacle on the way to an agreement remained Viktor Chernov, but he, taking advantage of the crisis and unpleasant rumors about him, still leaves the government on his own initiative. He motivated his resignation by a desire to regain "full freedom of action as a private person defending his political honor and pursuing slanderers," because because of his activities during his exile he was accused of working for German intelligence in the past for defeatist propaganda among Russian prisoners of war. The Central Committee of the Kadets went to Petrograd to participate in the formation of a new cabinet.Meanwhile, despite Tsereteli's departure, the Soviets continued to exert pressure on Kerensky; also the Temporary Committee of the State Duma, which suddenly announced itself, came into play and demanded that all socialist party leaders be removed from their posts, and since it too was a public organization, whose opinion was to be taken into account in forming the cabinet, it would be unseemly to ignore them."

It was here that Order No1 was born, because of which the great Russian army began its rapid decay. Although it is likely that the soldiers at the front who supported this order had been exposed to it before. As early as 1916 there were bad tendencies, which shows the competence of the tsarist government, but now things are several times worse. \nIn the Petrosoviet, Bolshevism rules the minds. No matter what they say about the Bolsheviks, the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are not much different from them, but they can still prove their loyalty. When our regiments marched on Petrograd, many members of the Petrosoviet opposed us with agitation and rifle. But now they are all in our hands.

But the activities of the Socialists, in words aimed at the benefit of the Russian people, in fact has always been directed to the detriment of the Russian statehood, whether they realized it or not. However, among the Socialists there are such honest people as Savinkov.

The deputies assembled in Moscow, in the Senate Palace on the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin, in Catherine Hall.

 bulgaria.1.t:0 "Defeat at Dobro Polje"
 bulgaria.1.desc:0 "After fierce fighting the Entente forces managed to break through our defenses at Dobro Polje and penetrate deep into Macedonia. Our allies, busy with operations on their fronts, were unable to provide serious assistance, causing excessive exhaustion of the Bulgarian army. With the retreat the desertion intensified. A revolt against the command began in several units under the slogans "On Sofia!", "Death to the perpetrators of war!" The rebels had the idea of marching on Sofia to overthrow the government and punish the tsar and all those who, in their opinion, were responsible for the war and defeats. In the present situation there is a proposal to release from prison a prominent politician who is an opponent of the war, Alexander Stamboliysky. He demands the immediate commencement of peace negotiations with Entente, but if we agree Stamboliyski's authority should be sufficient to pacify the rebellious soldiers."
 bulgaria.1.a:0 "Stamboliyski will ensure internal peace, but we will take care of external peace."
 bulgaria.1.b:0 "We will ask the Austro-German troops to assist in the suppression."
 bulgaria.2.t:0 "Stambolic Diplomacy".
 bulgaria.2.desc:0 "The government's plan was to use the popularity of the men sent to negotiate among the soldiers to stop the retreat and stabilize the front. The speeches of most of the politicians, however, did not make much of an impression on the rebels, and they were still determined to march on Sofia, although Minister Savov's suggestion that the retreating soldiers should be able to go home when they returned from the front instead of marching on the capital gained some support among the rebels, although most still insisted on an offensive. A delegation of politicians then decided to go to Kyustendil to assess the situation there and to inquire about the progress of negotiations with the Allies. That same day, Stamboliiski received a telegram from Daskalov, who had remained in Radomir and who had taken full control of the situation there, proposing that he should lead the uprising and unite the forces of over 15,000 soldiers in the two cities, ready to march on the capital and overthrow the monarchy. Stamboliyski, after some hesitation, agreed. To the applause of the soldiers he declared that the monarchy was henceforth overthrown and Bulgaria became a republic. The rebels now issue an ultimatum for the immediate transfer of power to Stambolinski and Daskalov and their Bulgarian Agricultural People's Union."
 bulgaria.2.a:0 "The situation requires the intervention of Austro-German troops."
 bulgaria.2.b:0 "We shall be fine on our own once we have reconciled with the Entente."
 bulgaria.2.c:0 "This is final defeat.
 bulgaria.3.t:0 "Joint Action."
 bulgaria.3.desc:0 "Approaching the capital of Bulgaria at the head of the rebel troops Raiko Daskalov decided to deliver an ultimatum stipulating that within a day he was to be given all power over Bulgaria. Without waiting for an answer Daskalov moved in several columns to attack Sofia. However, government forces, supported by German units, were able to stop Daskalov's advance and then put the rebels to flight."

 bulgaria.4.t:0 "The Fall of Sofia".
 bulgaria.4.desc:0 "Approaching the capital of Bulgaria at the head of the rebellious troops, Raiko Daskalov decided to deliver an ultimatum stipulating that within a day he was to be given full power over Bulgaria. Without waiting for an answer, Daskalov advanced in several columns, culminating in urban fights in Sofia. Unable to hold Daskalov back, the troops loyal to the throne withdrew in an orderly fashion.
 bulgaria.4.a:0 "The insurrection will nevertheless be put down."
 bulgaria.4.b:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 
 bulgaria.5.t:0 "Our position on Bulgaria."
 bulgaria.5.desc:0 "The Bulgarian state could not calmly endure a new defeat in the war, which led to its split and the outbreak of civil war. The revolt was raised by exhausted soldiers and socialist farmers, the old regime trying to fight back. The revolutionaries are usually less accommodating and more prone to international adventures, but the opposite side of the order is represented by the people who helped bring Bulgaria into the alliance with Germany."
 bulgaria.5.a:0 "The Bulgarians will destroy themselves.

 bulgaria.11.t:0 "The Bulgarians demand North Dobrogea."
 bulgaria.11.desc:0 "Since the Inter-Allied War, the Bulgarians have not lost hope of getting back the southern part of Dobrogea. This is their wish already fulfilled. But appetite comes with food, and now they are already laying claim to the whole of Dobrogea as the original Bulgarian land."
 bulgaria.11.a:0 "We have nothing to ensure control of northern Dobrogea."

 bulgaria.14.desc:0 "The Bulgarian government believes that the punitive measures carried out by Austrian troops in the Novi Pazar area against Serbian troublemakers are unreasonably hurting the local Bulgarian community. On this ground the Bulgarians are asking that this region be placed under their occupation. It must be said that no Bulgarians in southwestern Serbia, not only have not touched them, but they have not even seen them."

 bulgaria.17.desc:0 "For strategic reasons in the post-war world of our victory, to prevent further bloodshed and to finally lead Bulgaria to glory and wealth, we need access to a third, Adriatic Sea. This access is possible only through Albania or Montenegro, and the former is preferable to us.nnThe fate of Albania is still unresolved, which gives us great freedom of action. The diplomats have prepared three possible notes on this occasion. The first consists in demanding that direct rule be placed in the hands of our administration after the war, the second involves placing Prince Cyril on the Albanian throne, while the third insists on a Turkish prince; we should not fear that the Turks could somehow really govern Albania without direct access to it by land."
 bulgaria.17.a:0 "For the safety of Macedonia, Albania will be fully occupied."
 bulgaria.17.b:0 "Cyril of Preslav will take care of the good of the Albanian people."
 bulgaria.17.c:0 "The third note will please the Turks and play into our hands."
 bulgaria.18.t:0 "Bulgarian Initiative on Albania"
 bulgaria.18.desc:0 "The Bulgarians demand the complete transfer of Albania to their control after the end of the war. Such a decision would strike at the interests of Austria-Hungary and lead to the creation of a most powerful Slavic kingdom from the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea."
 bulgaria.18.d_2:0 "The Bulgarians demanded the transfer of the throne of Albania to Prince Cyril of Pereslavl. Obviously, this is only a form of securing Bulgarian control over Albania. However, if we agree the commitment would still have little consequence."
 bulgaria.18.d_3:0 "The Bulgarians propose to solve the Albanian question by creating a principality vassal to Turkey. It is clear that they are only trying to bring down the influence of the Habsburgs in this region, but the Ottomans might be interested in this initiative and should take it seriously."
 bulgaria.18.a:0 "Bulgaria's claims are just."
 bulgaria.18.b:0 "This is all baseless chauvinism."

 bulgaria.20.a:0 "They will answer for this yet."
 bulgaria.21.t:0 "A sword for the Bulgarian king."
 bulgaria.21.desc:0 "In 1915 the peasant army of this young Slavic state served great service for Germany and Austria by breaking the resistance of Serbia and blocking the Entente contingents at Salloniki.But Bulgaria has never been particularly industrialized, so the king insists on selling a large batch of German arms to secure another decisive offensive. It is planned that the heavy Krupp guns will break through the defensive line of the Entente troops, after which the mighty Bulgarian soldiers will bayonet and grenade the survivors.nBut it should be taken into account that in case of our common victory, God grant it, the large amount of artillery in the Bulgarian army will allow it to express its will more freely, contrary to the ambitions of Turkey and Austria."
 bulgaria.21.a:0 "We forge, only for stamps."
 bulgaria.21.b:0 "Some surplus can also be transferred for Bulgarian currency."
 bulgaria.21.c:0 "Refusal will cause a diplomatic scandal..."
 bulgaria.22.t:0 "Violation of Union debt".
 bulgaria.22.desc:0 "The Germans spit on our efforts by prohibiting the sale of heavy guns to the Bulgarian army. On the front there have long been rumors about the Germans' fear of us - as if they lied to the Bulgarian generals at the beginning of the war and stopped the army in front of half-empty Salloniki, so that Bulgaria would not take over the whole Greece! Probably after hearing about the German thrift, the soldiers would easily understand it as a lack of cannons from the Kaiser himself."
 bulgaria.22.a:0 "It's time to change course."

There is a gradual withdrawal of huge amounts of German marks from circulation, with which we have been buying up resources and businesses in this country. There are also reports of some kind of "nationalization plan" being prepared by the government with the knowledge of the Czar. Although Germany never had direct control over the Bulgarians, from all indications it appears that they are turning to a completely independent policy."
 bulgaria.23.a:0 "They must not be allowed to withdraw from the war."

 bulgaria.25.t:0 "Reject."

 bulgaria.29.t:0 "Bloodless Coup."
 bulgaria.29.desc:0 "This night German troops dared to occupy all the administrative buildings in Sofia. The Bulgarian army, ruled by conspirators from the Military League, offered no resistance. On the contrary, the higher officers declared these measures necessary in connection with an attempt on the life of the tsar by a certain revolutionary group. In fact, at this point the Tsar was blocked by his own soldiers and forced to sign the appointment of a new Prime Minister bypassing all procedures. In response, the old government declared itself dissolved."

 bulgaria.31.t:0 "The Cabinet of National Salvation"
 bulgaria.31.desc:0 "By all things it is clear that a historic time is coming for the Bulgarian kingdom. The Austro-German armies are straining all their strength, but can they withstand such an overload? While Berlin and Vienna are still arriving in imperial tranquility and steadfastness for Sofia there remains an opportunity to sign a profitable peace. Ultimately, the Germans have never shown sincerity toward Bulgaria-exploiting our economy, mopping up the mediocrity of Austrian generals with the blood of our soldiers, and opposing the complete unification of the Bulgarian people. Should the Tsar choose to look for peace there could be no better candidate to head the new government than Mr. Malinov, the head of the democrats, a skilful diplomat under whom the independence of Bulgaria was proclaimed. \On the other hand many people, including Mr. Radoslavov, think that we are one step away from victory, and that any possible break with the central powers should be postponed until the final incorporation of Macedonia and Dobrudja by peace treaties with the defeated kings of the Balkans.
 bulgaria.31.a:0 "Leave it to Malinov to form a coalition."
 bulgaria.31.b:0 "Radoslavov will remain prime minister, but will form a new cabinet."
 
 bulgaria.41.t:0 "Thunder over Morava"
 bulgaria.41.desc:0 "The Serbian government, despite the recent just end to the war, has not abandoned its aggressive plans and is actively spreading ideas of revenge within the country. It is not surprising that these ideas are being heated up by the top of Serbian society and are finding a lively response in the grassroots. For example, our border guards the day before had detained several agents of Serbian revolutionary circles who were trying to cross the border to foment rebellion and discontent. The Bulgarian Government, in view of the inadmissibility of repeating the catastrophe of the Inter-Union War, declines all responsibility and declares that in case of a repeat of the Serbian provocations it will not hesitate to order the army to cross the border and force the Morava River. The Serbs should bear in mind that in such a course of events Belgrade would be occupied within a week."
 bulgaria.41.a:0 "The nest of aggressors must be destroyed."
 bulgaria.42.t:0 "Threat of a protracted war."
 bulgaria.42.desc:0 "Constantinople is under our control, but Turkish resistance continues to grow despite the defeat in the border battle. We remember perfectly well how during the Balkan wars delaying peace negotiations with the Turks led to the disaster of the Bulgarian army. Is it worth continuing the campaign, which with each step turns into a new adventure? The Turks would probably not sign a peace agreement with the transfer of Constantinople, which would be too strong a blow to the imperial city."

 bulgaria.45.desc:0 "After the outbreak of war Bulgaria moved further and further away from the provisions of the good old Tarnovo Constitution. The opposition was thrown into prisons. The tsar relied more and more on direct rule, and even more began to listen, to the opinion of the army.

 bulgaria.52.desc:0 "Diplomats from Sofia arrived at our Southern Front headquarters. They insist on an equal peace with the retention of what they consider to be ethnically Bulgarian territories. Such a peace would deprive us of the possibility of collecting contributions from Bulgaria and disarming their army, but even worse, it would lead to confrontation with our allies in the Balkans. Thus the Serbs would never forgive the loss of Vardar Macedonia, and the Romanians would not tolerate the seizure of Dobrudja. Nor should it be forgotten that it was the treacherous actions of the Bulgarians in relation to their neighbors that led to the formation of the Salonika Front and the enormous losses among the Entente soldiers, prolonging the war indefinitely. On the other hand, acquiescence to Bulgarian conditions would avoid further casualties."

The turning point in the Bulgarian politics, which during the peace negotiations began with a small verbal exchange by Lapchev for the joint capture of Istanbul, can be regarded as accomplished. Henceforth the Bulgarian people together with the other free peoples fight a war against German-Turkish despotism.nThe majority of party leaders consider what happened to be a chance for Bulgaria to preserve its acquired lands and strengthen its international position. For example, the Farmers, who actively protested against the war in 1915, are now quite calm and patriotic about the reversal of the Bulgarian bayonets. The masses of peasant soldiers were greatly surprised by this course of events, and although most were simply hoping for a speedy end to this adventure, there were also cases of desertion. Meanwhile, many Close Socialists and more radical socialist groups have called for the sabotage of the new war 'in the interests of world imperialism.'"

In a short time the main nodes of the capital were seized, disloyal garrisons were blockaded, and leaders of leftist parties were arrested. No special resistance was met anywhere. A decree for a new government has already been signed."

 bulgaria.71.desc:0 "Throughout the country, the flames of rebellion are again blazing. Leftist groups dissatisfied with the existing situation have put arms in the hands of the peasants and workers and intend to change by force the unjust, in their opinion, social order. The army is on alert. The chances of the revolutionaries are probably not great, but they will fight desperately."
 bulgaria.71.a:0 "Radicals, will only hurt the Bulgarian people."
 bulgaria.71.b:0 "It's time for liberation."
 
 bulgaria.72.t:0 "Forced to peace".
 bulgaria.72.desc:0 "Militant rhetoric is again being heard in Bulgaria. Their government is seriously and openly discussing the possibility of tearing up the peace agreements just concluded. Against the background of the introduction of universal labor conscription in the country, which has essentially replaced military conscription, our generals have returned to elaborating anti-Bulgarian operations. Today we can use limited forces to prevent a new war in the Balkans."

 bulgaria.73.desc:0 "We succeeded in winning the border battle. The condition for ending the conflict was the demilitarization of the occupied region, which we consider strategic. We also demand compliance with the Neiit Accords, which the Bulgarians have violated. However, if we can provide demilitarization, then we can't control the secret mobilization and full compliance with the agreements. But now they will think ten more times."

 bulgaria.74.t:0 "Repel Attack"
 bulgaria.74.desc:0 "We failed to win the border battle, and the only reason they didn't counterattack is apparently the Inter-Allied Commission, otherwise they would have done it. We will not be able to force them to comply fully with the Neiit agreements, which the Bulgarians have violated, to use force again we cannot."

 bulgaria.75.desc:0 "Concerned about the return of an independent Bulgaria to international politics, our neighbors tried again to impose their dictate by military means. As expected, without the help of the troops of the Great Powers, the adventure of the aggressors failed. Only the pressure of the International Commission in Sofia prevented the troops from carrying out a crushing counterstrike."

Such boldness on the part of our neighbors only stirs up the anger in the hearts of Bulgarians. But it is true that we are still too weak. Perhaps we should refrain from harsh foreign policy statements.

 bulgaria.81.desc:0 "On August 2, 1915, Ivan Kolev was promoted to major general. Since May 1916 he was an inspector of cavalry and commander of the 1st Cavalry Division. Under his command the division took part in the successful offensive of the 3rd Army in Dobrudja. It participated in the battles of Kurtbunar, Kochmar, Karapelit, Dobrich, Toprahisar, Tekirgyol, Kyustenge, Černá Voda and Machina, fighting against the Russian, Serbian and Romanian forces. On January 3, 1917 the hurried cavalry division overcame the defensive barriers and took by storm the heavily fortified position of Machin. For his combat exploits, Kolev was awarded the Iron Cross "For Valor".nnGeneral Kolev proved himself a skillful cavalry commander, a good tactician, tried to spare the lives of his subordinates. All this time, the general bore the hardships of war together with the staff of the division, taking part in the fighting on his black stallion Pirin. Unfortunately, the hardships of war led him to a serious illness that the brave general was no longer able to cope with."

He decided to seek the support of the front-line units in suppressing the uprising in the capital, for which he met with General Krasnov. Despite the solidarity of large numbers of soldiers with the ideas of the revolution and the image of Kerensky as a traitor Kornilov (many officers did not go after him because of this), they still managed to put together a detachment of counterrevolutionary forces and move it to the capital from Pskov. Apart from a part of the Cossacks, the troops of the Northern Front expressed no desire to march, and about 5 thousand bayonets and sabers are now advancing on Petrograd."

Kornilov had long suspected that events in Petrograd would turn out this way, but did not have time to react when the uprising was just beginning, but now the troops around the capital, which had been located in advance, were ready to move on the city. Their numbers are difficult to estimate, but they probably do not exceed fifty thousand at the very best for the counterrevolution."

The expectation of breaking the front and forcing the revolutionary soldiers to retreat did not materialize. With the support of artillery from the area of the Pulkovo Observatory and the Allied armored train, the Red Guards managed to hold off all the attacks and go on a decisive counteroffensive. Apparently, Krasnov was waiting for reinforcements and ordered a retreat to Gatchina. Under the threat of encirclement of his positions they had to retreat to Gatchina also from Tsarskoye Selo, having abandoned their artillery.nThe Bolsheviks Dybenko and Trukhin who arrived in Gatchina discussed with Krasnov's Cossacks the terms of the truce, Kerensky fled, the next day Gatchina was occupied by the Red Guards and Krasnov surrendered to the revolution."
 rcw_bolsheviks.4.desc_1:0 "Kornilov's troops, who launched an offensive near Pulkovo, were unable for a long time to break the defense of the Red Guards units, eventually they succeeded, but further advance was hampered. Agitators, sent to negotiate with the masses of soldiers, caused disruption in the ranks of the rebels, and the counterrevolution lost the ability to conduct an offensive. This gave us time to rebuild forces and deliver artillery from Kronstadt, which allowed us to equip a more substantial position and the Pulkovo Observatory. At the next attack the enemy succeeded with considerable losses, forcing the Red Guard to retreat, but the closer Petrograd was, the more the units were morally decaying and it became clear that the agitators were stronger than bullets.n Having found itself in a stalemate, the counterrevolution saw no way to do anything that would not cause mass disarmament, and retreated to Gatchina, while Kerensky fled. From there Kornilov tried once more to contact the commander of the Northern Front, after which he fled from the rallying and dispersed mass of soldiers, together with Krasnov and the Cossacks who had advanced home to the Don, after which the Red Guard detachments entered Gatchina."

But the closer they came to the city, the dimmer were the prospects for success of the campaign, because the Junkers' uprising was suppressed.\nKrasnov reached the Nikolayevskaya railroad. The counterrevolution had two options: to wind up the operation and go to Moscow, or to move inside Petrograd. Krasnov decided to attack the revolutionary capital.nIn the beginning he met suspiciously weak resistance, but not having enough forces to establish direct control over the city, he divided his units into Cossack detachments to bring revolutionary supporters to obedience and organize a counterrevolutionary militia on the ground. But such a strategy resulted in the Red Guards outnumbering the Cossacks in individual skirmishes. Krasnov suffered losses. This forced the counterrevolution to gather all its forces in a fist and move in a decisive attack on Smolny. But the units locked in the narrow streets of Petrograd could not withstand the battle on the barricades and were knocked down by the revolutionary wave.The city swallowed them up.The remnants of the Cossacks and Krasnov himself managed to leave the city and moved to the south."

The city froze in fear. Kornilov's units, advancing into the center, smashed the barricades of the Red Guards and were already approaching the revolutionary headquarters. But at the same time individual squads of soldiers and Cossack detachments sent by Krasnov were often destroyed by revolutionary soldiers. Fighting in the streets became more frequent and more fierce, the Kornilovites on Ligovsky Avenue were met with artillery fire. Going forward with only the most reliable units, Kornilov got into a situation from which it was impossible to come out the winner. Snapping back with fierce fire, the counterrevolution suffered losses at every step, and before reaching the center of resistance, the Kornilovtsy were brought down by a revolutionary whirlwind. Hanged men were removed from poles, corpses were fished out of the Moika. Having dispersed the counterrevolutionary detachments, the Red Guards still long prowled through the streets in search of the Kornilovites who had fled.The city absorbed them.Kornilov, the remnants of the Cossacks and Krasnov himself managed to leave the city and moved south."

An all-Russian strike of the old bureaucratic apparatus paralyzed any action of the new government, and the local Soviets, which began to take power, for the most part found themselves outside the control of the policies adopted in Petrograd. A wave of spontaneous expropriations is sweeping the country, and the workers who were supposed to take control of the factories are tearing the enterprises to pieces. The peasants refuse to pay taxes, and the Soviets even demand money from the center for their own needs.nThe Soviets thought that since they were the "victorious class," they owed them everything and they owed nobody, and that nothing had to be done. But the uprising in the capital was only a trigger for them, the ground for this behavior was prepared by the entire previous course of revolutionary events. The workers, unprepared for running the state, had yet to learn the revolutionary discipline that circumstances demanded of them. The bourgeoisie says they have been driven away, but ruin will bring them back to power, and it is the duty of every conscious worker to struggle to prove to the world that the oppressed masses can take control of the factories and themselves. \n\nIn the near future we cannot hope that the purchasing power of the ruble will remain at least at its current level."

At the same time, because the army hierarchy has remained intact, they have shown relatively low productivity. As a result, no more than a quarter of the personnel in all the labor armies is engaged in economic activity, apart from the first one.

Its editor-in-chief, Bukharié, came out with an article in which, in order to avoid overkill, the Cheka was dissolved as a single body, and all justice was placed in the hands of the courts and the militia.

The peasants, not receiving manufactory, plows, nails, tea and other essentials, are disappointed in the purchasing power of money and stop selling their stocks, preferring to store bread instead of money. Crisis exacerbated by the lack of banknotes for retribution in those places where the dumping is still being done. \n\nAnalysis of the existing situation leads to three options for solving the problem:\n1) supplying the village with what it requires, that is, basic necessities that will help bring into the world hidden bread;\n2) to carry out vigorous state punitive measures to ensure the food dictatorship. \n\nCommodity exchange is already taking place everywhere in connection with bagging (factory workers exchange their product for food for themselves).It is possible to stop this spontaneous process only by solving the crisis collection of grain from the peasants, or by organizing bagging on the scale of the state \n\nPeasants have surpluses that they don't want to give away just like that, but want to be paid. On the one hand, we understand them perfectly, but the workers' state has nothing to pay them off in a crisis, and their bread is needed here and now in order to improve the economy to some extent. We will not be able to meet their current demands, and the danger of counter-revolution and intervention has not disappeared. At the same time, there is an idea that if you take not everything in excess of what is needed for food and sowing, but a share, the peasants will be less willing to reduce the area under crops under the pretext that everything will be taken from above anyway. Another thing is that it is impossible to ensure strict control over this share (for the time being), and how much bread it will be possible to get in this way is unknown. Also, for the needs of the countryside, energetic measures can be taken to convert military production into the production of hammers, nails, cloth, and other things for the countryside. But the effectiveness of such a measure is doubtful in view of the unwillingness of the peasants, in principle, to hand over bread even for goods, more often they demand currency, but there is none."

After the occupation of the building of the Ministry of Food by the Soviets, it ceased to function, and its employees joined the strike of the officials. The Soviets took power locally, but the formed People's Commissariat for Food was still unable to implement policies because of a weak apparatus, the management system had fallen into complete disorder. \now the food dictatorship confirmed by decree began to be implemented by both the gradually strengthening central authorities and local Soviets, but this news is clouded by other facts: our allies in the revolutionary government from the Party of Left Socialist Revolutionaries (Internationalists) are strongly against such a They say that it cannot be subordinated to the central bodies, and that the conscious working peasantry itself can cope with the collection and distribution of food, this must be handled by the local Soviets. The use of "punitive expeditions" (food squads) for requisitions is a completely unnecessary and even harmful measure. The implementation of the decree is going badly as it is, but this is superimposed by the fact that it is sabotaged by the local party cells of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries in a number of provinces: Yaroslavl, Kaluga, Kazan, Tambov,Nizhniy Novgorod, and so on."

The implementation of the food dictatorship in the countryside is impossible without the kombeds, and it is they who must engage in the search for bread concealed by hostile elements of the heterogeneous peasant class. The kombeds should redistribute requisitioned food, livestock and farm implements among the villagers. \nPPLSR strongly criticized this policy on the part of the SNK. Vladimir Karelin, a member of the Central Committee of the LPSR, read out a declaration at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee which can be briefly summarized as follows: the use of prodotunks for requisitions undermines "the creativity of the masses," the expression of which are peasant Soviets, undermines trust in Soviet power; "only the peasantry should manage the affairs of food supply - local Soviets". According to the rapporteur, the creation of kombeds destroys the Soviet power, splits the village, undermines the ability of local Soviets to deal with the pests and kulaks, kombeds ignore the interests of most of the working peasantry, "and negligence in the local organization worsens the situation even more".

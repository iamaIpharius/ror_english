 RISEOFRUSSIA_NAME:0 "Arise, Russia!"
 RISEOFRUSSIA_DESC:0 "For two and a half years the war has gone on, where thousands of soldiers are killed daily, millions of bullets and shells wasted. It is as if everybody has already forgotten the original occasion. In the west the war has taken a positional character, while in the east the movements continue, although after the de facto failure of the Brusilovsky breakthrough there is little hope of a quick end to the war. The Russian tsar is planning an offensive, but its possible success is doubtful. The war, thought of as an easy walk, has exhausted the national forces and put a number of empires in danger of death at the hands of their own workers, who do not want to fight."
 RUS_RISEOFRUSSIA_DESC:0 "Russia entered the twentieth century in a strange state - amazing progress stood alongside centuries of backwardness and a bouquet of soreness from Alexander III: the unresolved land question, the terrible situation of the working class, parliamentarism driven underground. defeat in the Russian-Japanese war showed the weakness of the Russian army in comparison with even not the most advanced countries, and from this defeat, as well as the subsequent revolution of 1905-1907, the monarchy has been learned too few lessons.n During the Great War, the Russian army almost only retreated. The situation heats up: a conspiracy matures in the Duma, more and more people turn away from the emperor, in the capital there are problems with the supply of basic goods: bread and sugar."
 GER_RISEOFRUSSIA_DESC:0 "In 1871, standing on the breast of defeated France, the Prussians proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles the creation of the German Empire. This triumph, however, did not lead her to immediate domination of Europe, and the further logic of the development of capitalism pushed the country toward colonialism. Germany did not manage to share the major part of Africa and had to eat crumbs but tried to join the ranks of world hegemons and doomed itself to war.nThe later Great War was devouring the vitality of the whole of Europe. The Prussian spirit allowed the Germans to endure hardship as long as there was faith that Germany was on the verge of triumph, but with each passing day the battle looked more and more like the agony of an authoritarian Junker regime."
 BUL_RISEOFRUSSIA_DESC:0 "The modern history of Bulgaria begins with its liberation in the war of 1877-1878 by Russian troops from Turkish rule. But the pressure of the European Concert at the Berlin Congress overrode the San Stefano Boundary Plan and set the stage for the irrepressible ambition of the newly-created state. Formal independence of the principality and the proclamation of its kingdom occurred as early as 1908. The Balkan wars led Bulgaria to what was later called a national catastrophe. Believing that Vardar Macedonia was an unjustly alienated Bulgarian land and wishing for revenge, in 1915 the Bulgarians entered the Great War on the side of Germany. Politicians who protested against this act were thrown into prison."
 
 RUSSIANREVOLUTION_NAME:0 "Red Dawn"
 RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The peoples await peace. Russia has been freed from tsarism, but the Provisional Government failed to keep its promises and almost allowed a reaction. The Bolshevik Party raised the banner of revolt and took power. Under radically new slogans, they sought the support of the workers of all the warring countries, so that together they could carry out the common task of crushing the "elites" leading them to slaughter. The RSDLP, moved by Marx's doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the World Revolution, challenges war, poverty, hunger, and the world bourgeoisie, and calls on all the workers of the world to break their chains, for they have nothing to lose but them."
 RUS_RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "It is a great misfortune that the workers' party has to solve purely bourgeois problems in a backward country besides its own, but the RSDLP has taken the risk, for there is no one else but them. The civil war is on the doorstep, though not all is lost yet, and a left-wing coalition can still prevent it. Nevertheless, a number of left-wing parties such only in words, the SR has already put the political power above its own program. \n Under the tsarist regime, there were no plans for electrification, except sketches and deeds of enthusiasts. The aristocracy did not need it. The aristocracy believes that the masses do not need education; only the "elite" need it. And the bourgeoisie cannot and never will give people freedom of labor, because their objective interest is oppression. Workers can only restrain their own happiness."
 
 BUL_RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The modern history of Bulgaria begins with its liberation in the war of 1877-1878 by Russian troops from Turkish rule. But the pressure of the European Concert at the Berlin Congress overrode the San Stefano plan of borders and set the stage for the irrepressible ambition of the newly-created state. Formal independence of the principality and the proclamation of its kingdom occurred as early as 1908. The Balkan wars led Bulgaria to what was later called a national catastrophe. Believing that Vardar Macedonia was an unjustly alienated Bulgarian land and wishing for revenge, in 1915 the Bulgarians entered the Great War on the side of Germany. Politicians who protested against this act were thrown into prison."
 DON_RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The Don region is famous for its wealth. Some of the highest harvests are obtained here. Now the Don, like the rest of the country, is split by contradictions. Settler peasants, called out-of-towners, workers and miners in industrial Novorossia, and some local Cossacks support radical socialists. At the same time, the Don ataman, formally the head of the region and a reference point for the conservative part of the Cossacks, is sharply anti-Bolshevik. Help from the right from outside would undoubtedly turn the Don into a counterrevolutionary base."
 BKL_RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "Having traveled the not-so-close way from the Romanian and Caucasian fronts through Petrograd to his native Transbaikalia, Grigory Semenov managed to take part in organizing Assyrian detachments, planning yet another coup attempt, preventing the cossacking of Transbaikals and the venture to organize a counterrevolution using revolutionary money. Now Cossack was forced to retreat to the exclusion zone of the CEL. But will it stop a real adventurer and Russian nationalist, especially when there are half a dozen of loyal Cossacks, Buryats, Mongols and an Ostseian baron at hand? The Bolsheviks have little power here: there are few workers in Transbaikalia, and the land question has the color of a conflict between the Russian settlers and locals, and there are no kulaks and landlords at all."
 OCH_RUSSIANREVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The Orenburg Host is the third largest Cossack Host, characterized both by high urban literacy and by the absence of any significant industry and thus of a labor movement. Like the rest of the country, it is in crisis. The recently elected ataman and the senior Cossacks are openly opposed to the Bolsheviks who are weak in the area, but the masses are unwilling to participate in the conflict, and the moderate Socialists who have considerable influence over the Cossacks are ready to take over power if they agree. Being on the sidelines of the main events, having at the side of troubled Siberia and the lurking Volga region, the Orenburg Cossack Host can both become one of the centers of resistance to the Red forces, and ingloriously perish in the abyss of fratricidal struggle."
 
 RUSSIANSMUTA_NAME:0 "Russian Smuta"
 RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The new government in Russia is almost a year old. Its leaders, seeing the impossibility of continuation of the war, began negotiations with the Germans, but a number of failed diplomatic maneuvers led them to the abyss, they had to accept harsh conditions, and the counter-revolution did not weaken the old army, already completely decomposed, was unable to suppress the centers of rebellion, and the rebellion of the Czechoslovak corps put the government in a catastrophic situation. Even the WW1 is about to end - German Forces are running out."
 CCA_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The Constituent Assembly was the dream and goal of the Russian revolutionary movement. In January 1918, the Bolsheviks shattered the dream - they decided to implement the revolutionary program bypassing the procedures. The Assembly, which disagreed with the premature decrees of the new authorities, was dispersed in order to revive again on the Volga with the help of the Czechoslovak rebellion "This new struggle has been going on for two months. Kazan has been taken by a small detachment. But the enemy is also preparing to strike. In this situation, the members of the Committee of the Academic Assembly begin to search for a state compromise with the unreliable government of Siberia."
 SIB_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "Remote from Moscow and fenced off by the Ural Mountains, the expanses of Siberia soon fell out of the hands of the Soviet authorities, when the echelons of Czechs stretched along the road took up arms. Maybe it was a pure accident, but nonetheless. But the Siberians did not doze: a new government was immediately formed from the healthiest elements of the nation - those who managed to come faster. Its army, forged from young people with dashing Cossack chieftains and volunteer officers, mobilized to prepare to strike a mortal blow at the heart of Bolshevism. And perhaps the entire "revolution""
 RUS_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "After the forced obscene peace of Brest-Litovsk in March, we had to leave two-thirds of Russian fertile lands and half of industry to the Kaiser's dogs. with Krasnov's Cossacks in the south, the British in the north, in the Volga region, the so-called "People's Army" of Komuch took Kazan a week ago, and Izhevsk was captured by the White Guard provocateurs who disrupted the mobilization.If in March almost all of Russia was in the hands of the working people, the counter-revolution successfully unleashed a bloody civil war, and the goal of this motley gang is the same - to bring back the manufacturers."
 RVA_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The first of the anti-Bolshevik armies, the Volunteer Army formed on the Don, continues its offensive against the Kuban and the Caucasus. Behind are the "ice campaign" and the tragic death of Kornilov, ahead of hundreds of thousands of Sorokinets and their allied mountain bands. The Germans are already hosting on the Don. Georgia is so is ready to oppose forces that do not accept the dismemberment of Russia. Nevertheless, Generals Alekseev and Denikin are confident of success. Victory here will allow us to step inland. And this step will shake red Moscow."
 NRR_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the German threat to military supplies lying here since 1916, the dissatisfaction of the Democrats with the political methods of Moscow and, finally, the uprising of the Czechoslovaks - finally set the flywheel of civil war in the north. Organized mainly by monarchist officers Alexander Muruzi and Georgy Chaplin, together with the coup in Arkhangelsk by the socialists and the subsequent landing of the allied troops with the proclamation of the Supreme Administration of the Northern Region instantly brought down the power of the soviets throughout the Arkhangelsk province. But the friction between the officers, guided by the concepts of honor, and the socialists - romantics - has not disappeared, which threatens the newly formed government with severe shocks."
 DON_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The uprising of the Don people, outraged by decossackization and the power of the commissars, successfully coincided with the German advance through the illusory red lines of the Treaty of Brest. The offensive that brought the Germans to Rostov and made the masters of Millerovo. At this time, General Krasnov achieved the ataman's mace. His bet on Germans regularly sending "Mausers" for bread, does not seem justified to everyone. The closest neighbors in the anti-Bolshevik struggle in their headquarters call Krasnov nothing more than a "prostitute."
 IZH_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The news of the fall of Kazan set in motion a confrontation long overdue in Izhevsk. Feeling their instability, the Bolsheviks tried to mobilize and snatch out potential rebels from the Union of Front-line Soldiers, but everything turned out differently. The plant has rebelled. The surrounding factories are asking the rebels for help. Partisan detachments, which previously had no flag, join the "People's Army". Yes, now only Izhevsk has risen, but it is already clear that this is not the second Yaroslavl. In addition, the rebels do not have a clear political program and are ready for any form of power. "
 OCH_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "Since January, on the outskirts of Orenburg, every nightskirmishes. The Cossacks raided the city, the military revolutionary committee made bloody raids on the villages, Commissar Zwilling, trying to crush the riot, only kindled it and was killed for it. The struggle ended with the movement of the Czechs, when Ataman Dutov, who had gone to the Turgai steppes in the spring, returned to Orenburg, abandoned by the Reds on the shoulders of the Cossacks, clearing out the remnants of the Soviet authorities. Now the Army is at a crossroads, because, having sworn allegiance to Komuch, the ataman is still trying to balance between all the forces in the region, given the control of the Siberians over part of the territory of the Army. In addition, the Cossack youth is dissatisfied with the line of the ataman and constitutes a dangerous opposition, which can have far-reaching consequences."
 UCH_RUSSIANSMUTA_DESC:0 "The Battle of Iletsk in March launched the participation of the Old Believer Ural Cossack Host in the civil war. Despite modest military forces, small resources and limited communication with the allies, the Gorynych Urals continue for many months to fight bravely against the overwhelming number of Antichrists, trying not to give back not an inch of their land."

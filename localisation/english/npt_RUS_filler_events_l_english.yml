 russia_filler.52.d:0 "American journalist and reporter for socialist views, John Reed, came to Russia immediately after the Kornilov uprising. In transit through Finland, he, together with his wife, got to Petrograd. Reed, despite his socialist views, does not pose a danger, most likely he will simply write about all the events associated with the revolution. \nHe had already gained some popularity after his book, published in 1914. «Risen Mexico» about the civil war in Mexico. And we can say that since then he has developed a flair for «interesting» political events. His arrival may mean that while he is not going to get involved in anything, he anticipates imminent changes in the political climate, and he may be damn right."

 russia_filler.53.d:0 "John Reed, who recently left Russia, after his visit to find out about the events in Russia and collect materials, published a book on them «Ten days that shook the world», telling about the Bolshevik revolution. Initially, the US government opposed the publication of this book, but Reed assured them that he viewed these events from a neutral point of view, in order to establish the truth, although the book itself clearly shows sympathy for the Bolsheviks, and it has already become popular among socialist leaders, as well as ordinary workers in the United States. Reed promises that he will later release a second volume, and has already begun collecting materials. \nThe book is already being prepared for translation into Russian and distribution among the broad Russian masses.."

 rcw_don_cca.1.t:0 "The Banner of the Revolution"
 rcw_don_cca.1.desc:0 "It is no secret that the Socialist-Revolutionary Party has throughout its history waged an irreconcilable struggle against autocracy in all its manifestations. Naturally, the banner of the Social Revolutionaries was the red banner of the revolution; it also became the banner of the new government, which began the struggle against the Bolsheviks. It seemed to be clear to everyone that the Bolsheviks could not represent the revolution because they ruled tyrannically, and they no longer had any right to the red color. Nevertheless, all over the region incidents involving Cossacks, who because of red flags take our institutions for Bolshevik institutions and try to arrest them or vandalize them, have become more frequent. Our explanations often do not reach the Cossacks. It is even worse to inculcate in the Cossack masses the idea of fighting reaction. The Cossacks look upon the Social Revolutionaries with disapproval, but for the time being they still continue to fight on the side of the people's government. "

He was leading a shock regiment and tried to defend the stakes from the Bolsheviks and then lead his detachment out to us. Not yet halfway across, the shock troops were surrounded by superior forces and defeated. Nevertheless, Manakin made his way to the Don and is ready to continue the fight. It's worth noting, however, that this colonel, by his active participation in the revolutionary activities, arouses mistrust among many in the army. Some call him 'comrade'."

They have begun to create their own newspaper, in which they propagate radically leftist ideas, attack the leadership of the army, and among other things discuss the possibility of peace with the Reds. Despite the credibility of these comrades in most of the party, there is growing resentment in the army-many suspect Volsky of working for the Bolsheviks. "

While Pokrovsky's men marched with banners unfurled and bayonets drawn, his adjutant delivered an ultimatum to disband all organs of the Kuban Republic until the Don Committee could decide their fate later. Cossacks and Circassians loyal to the Rada were cut off in advance. In view of the suddenness of the coup, the frightened Radyans were forced to sign an ultimatum, after which General Pokrovsky spoke from the balcony of the government announcing to the troops the reunification of the Kuban with democratic Russia. The news was greeted with jubilation. "

The matter is that Pokrovsky demanded that about two thousand hardened fighters of people's army be sent to Kuban together with him, in case the loyalists of Rada blocked his way back. Our command claims that with this arrangement, a clash between Pokrovsky and the Radyans would be taken by the Kuban Republic as the beginning of war and we would get a new front in the south. "

And after the Kubans threatened to open fire, General Pokrovsky came out of the ranks of the People's Army to them, and declared that from now on, the power of the Rada was declared overthrown because of the "manifest betrayal of the cause of the unification of Russia." He also called to go over to his side and fight together against the Bolsheviks. After such a turn of events, the Kuban dared not start a fight. However, a little later, having come to their senses, some of the officers sent messengers to other detachments and began to gather forces to confront Pokrovsky. "

A clever man, he quickly understood the environment in which he found himself and, therefore, did not hesitate to rush democratic slogans before the Committee and the Cossacks, keeping his men in the strictest discipline. His brutality, however, scares away runaway politicians from the capital, but it is very much to the hearts of the soldiers on the front lines and staff officers in the rear. Pokrovsky earns more and more sympathy from different strata of society and risks becoming too popular without having a clear place in the hierarchy of the committee authorities. Many feel that it is time to do something about this. "

After the victory of the usurpers in Russia, he managed to gather the backbone of patriotic officers and together with them went to the Don. Upon arriving here, the organization had time to take part in battles and tried to conduct a dialogue with the army circle and the Cossacks as equals. However, the Cossacks found it in their own interest to hand over power to the democratic forces, and so [CCA.GetName] was formed. Now, many officers of the Alyakseevskys had transferred to the People's Army, while the rest became hostages of the organization's uncertain status before the new authorities. Another part of the officers are hardcore reactionaries, who fundamentally reject the legitimacy of our government and are ready, even in words... The main problem for us is the autonomy of the Alyakseevs. As long as the "volunteers" do not recognize the supremacy of the "People's Army", putting these troops side by side will be dangerous for the integrity of the front. In addition, who will guarantee that the words of the reactionaries will not become deeds? Perhaps only General Alexeyev himself. "

But negotiations would not be negotiations if the officers did not want to insist on their terms. From the mouth of the aged leader they demand to keep the units in unity, to allow them to wear their own insignia, and to give the main leaders of the movement access to politics and command positions. It should be understood that the first would preserve the de facto autonomy of the volunteers, the second would set them apart from the general mass of troops, however, not particularly homogeneous now, and the last would bring many opponents of democracy back into the legal field.

The Cossacks are still loyal to their generals and love to gossip about the affairs of the army circle. In such a situation, it is logical to simply conclude a contract with the Cossack leaders, especially we have something to bargain about. First of all, some authoritative Cossacks are already actively cooperating with our Committee and openly show interest in all-Russian politics. It is not difficult to suppose, that the Cossack generals are very vain and for a good post they will provide us with the necessary level of loyalty. Second, the same trick can be pulled by appointing Cossacks to key positions in the People's Army. Although this runs the risk of usurpation of the entire army by a bunch of generals and obviously will not please the officers-democrats. Third, most Cossacks are wary and distrustful of the efforts of our radicals to promote the agrarian reforms. By giving the Cossacks guarantees not to undertake the final division of land in the region we will be able to gain the support of all strata of the Cossacks, but will lose in popularity with the local "out-of-towners.""

And now we are already receiving numerous complaints about Cossacks appropriating previously demarcated land, about restoration of property rights for landlords, and finally about the expulsion of non-Russian peasants from some territories.

However, beyond the border of the army region, Cossack units become ineffective, refusing to fight and thereby undermining the combat effectiveness of the entire People's Army. The reason is simple: Cossacks do not understand the need to fight for all of Russia; in their view, by holding their own region, they can somehow make peace with the Reds. We need to prepare an agitation, explaining to the Cossacks the essence of the all-Russian struggle of the Committee and the People's Army. First of all, we can emphasize the democratic element, we can explain to the Cossacks that without freedom for the whole Russia, freedom for the Don is impossible, we can make them understand that we are fighting against the usurpers of their legitimate rights. Secondly, it is possible to play on the traditional world view of the Cossacks and their adherence to Orthodoxy, because the battle with the Antichrist does not involve a peace agreement. And finally, some believe it is possible to fan the flames of national pride in the Cossacks, with which they so recently burned as part of the Russian Empire."

However, the immediate establishment of autonomies could fragment the forces of multinational democracy. "

 rcw_don_cca_news.1.desc:0 "After being expelled from the Don by the moderate government, General Kornilov and his comrades tried to break through to Siberia. With great difficulty they overcame the distance from the Don to the coast of the Caspian Sea and faced the problem of overcoming this natural obstacle. It was not possible to take all the Whites to the other shore at once. Therefore, General Kornilov, taking a small detachment of officers as well as his closest comrades-in-arms,Nezhentsev and Simanovsky, set off, ordering the others to make camp and await news. Meanwhile, the ship carrying the first group of Kornilovs encountered several Red Flotilla raiders. At this point it is already reliably known that this campaign was General Kornilov's last."

 rcw_don_cca_news.2.desc:0 "The Russian Civil War once again marked a sharp turn. After the Bolshevik revolution, the left-wing and right-wing socialist revolutionaries, who found themselves on opposite sides of the barricades, decided to stop the mutual bloodshed. Now the former "rebels" will sit down at the same table in the Kremlin as those who were in the cart of Bolshevik politics. Recall that the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had earlier carried out a successful anti-Bolshevik coup, taking power into their own hands and thus eliminating a key link that hindered their reconciliation with their former comrades-in-arms."

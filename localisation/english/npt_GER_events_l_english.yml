 germany.1.t:0 "Telegram to Mexico"
 germany.1.desc:0 "Late last year our Foreign Minister, Artut Zimmerman, devised a plan to bring Mexico into the war on the side of Germany in the event that the United States broke its neutrality and began actively assisting the Entente. \The anticipated resumption of total submarine warfare should not give the United States a reason to violate neutrality, but should Washington decide to enter the war, our ambassador to Mexico, Heinrich von Eckhardt, would be instructed to contact the Mexican president to induce him to launch hostilities against the United States on the side of the Central Powers. In the event of victory, Mexico receives Texas,New Mexico, and Arizona."

 germany.2.t:0 "Intercept German telegram."
 germany.2.desc:0 "Immediately after being sent by United States diplomatic mail, this telegram was intercepted and sent to "Room 40" for decoding. From the decrypted text, it is clear that Germany is trying to induce Mexico to join the war on the side of the Central Powers to maintain U.S. neutrality, and this is a brilliant opportunity to draw the United States into the Entente war.We have two problems: how to explain receipt of the decrypted text without showing Germany that its cipher has been broken, and how to explain the interception without revealing details about the British special services' viewing of almost U.S. diplomatic mail. But we may as well not pass on the text of the dispatch to the Americans."

The main problem for the Young Turks now was the confrontation between the civil power and the military power, and the military with each other. The underlying confrontation did not improve the situation in the country. \Should the balance of power be disturbed, the situation could come to the point of a coup.
 TUR_zazhralis:0 "Miserable Bureaucracy"
 TUR_zazhralis_desc:0 "The burden of empire has been heavy on Turkey since the days when the Beylik began its ascendancy. State-building has always been a difficult business, especially when Europe opened up the New Age and the Ottoman Empire ceased to pose a significant threat to it. The first features of the modern systemic crisis began to appear in the nineteenth century. Turkey's apparatus of government is now plagued by cronyism and departmentalism, as well as overexpenditures for its maintenance. This is not to say that the Turkish system is not generating progressive forces, but only their purposeful activity will be able to heal the country."

 TUR_raised_taxes:0 "High Taxes"
 TUR_raised_taxes_desc:0 "To plug the holes in the budget because of the war, the Young Turk government imposed extraordinary taxes. Now the tax burden on a single peasant is about 2/3 of his income.

The longer the war goes on, the tighter the knot around Turkey's neck and the harder the postwar recovery will be."

 TUR_permanent_political_crisis:0 "Extremely High Political Instability"
 TUR_permanent_political_crisis_desc:0 "With Turkey's surrender in World War I, the country fell into chaos. The Young Turks' Unity and Progress Party, which had actually turned from a political party into a derivative of the administrative apparatus, immediately collapsed. There were no major political forces to replace it. Foreign troops occupied most of the country. The central government is weaker than ever. Ministerial resignations followed one after another. Added to this is the economic ruin, which has no thought of recovery. And absolutely everyone blames the foreigners and the sultan's weak government for what is happening."

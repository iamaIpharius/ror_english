After the establishment of Soviet power Semenov, having permission not only from the Provisional Government, but also from the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, continued to form the Buryat-Mongolian horse-drawn Cossack detachment in Transbaikalia. But it no longer accepted not only Mongols and Buryats, but also Russians. The condition for admission to the regiment was "renunciation of revolutionaryism. "Having realized that Semenov was creating anti-Bolshevik units, the Chita Soviet of Workers' Deputies delayed the payment of money to form the detachment. Some time later Semenov started an anti-Soviet action at Nizhnyaya Beryozovka station, but the local village congress, to which he appealed, did not support his initiative and told the Regional Soviet and the Committee of Public Security to arrest Semenov and disarm his unit.nFor now Semenov is in Manchuria with money taken out of Chita and is supported by the CEL manager Dmitry Horvat."

However, if you think about it soberly, we ourselves do not have many allies, and such drastic actions can force the masses of the People's Army to ally with Moscow.

Alexey Grishin-Almazov distinguished himself on the fronts of the German war and stood at the origins of the underground organization in Novo-Nikolayevsk, and with the proclamation of the Siberian government thanks to his military and organizational talents was able to take high positions. Here he made many enemies. First, Grishin ignored the left-wing ministers and completely quarrelled with Grigory Patushinsky. Second, he openly proclaimed right-wing slogans and was even said to have been seen singing "God Save the Tsar." Third, he recently demanded that the government unconditionally recognize the rightness of war with Germany.

This terrible event immediately caused an unprecedented explosion of public indignation. First and foremost, the leftists began to accuse Ivan Mikhailov of the murder, allegedly trying to put pressure on the SR members of the government in this way. This version is quite plausible, if we take into account the available information about Novoselov's detention on the eve of the murder by the Cossacks of the Omsk garrison on the order of the head of the garrison, Volkov. On the other hand, Volkov himself claims that Novoselov was a member of a group plotting a coup and was therefore arrested. However, he is silent about the fact of the murder, as unknown. It is now vital for the government to respond to the incident. If we side with the Social Revolutionaries and try to arrest Mikhailov and Volkov, the influence of right-wing circles will be greatly reduced; if we accept that Novoselov was the real conspirator, it will greatly increase the influence of the reactionaries in the government.

But it is also necessary to explain to the Siberians what they are fighting for, and such a propaganda campaign may require large resources, temporarily stalling administrative reform."
 rcw_usfev.58.desc_4:0 "Mr. Sakharov does not represent much military authority among the Siberian generals, but has rather reactionary views. It is likely that this factor was decisive for the transfer of power to him. And the general justified the hopes of the white rebels, in his first speech calling for the cleansing of the liberated lands from the hidden enemies and warmongers. Sakharov especially noted the heinous deeds of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and their Jewish accomplices. The constructive part of the speech was reduced to asserting the need for a united and powerful counterintelligence."

As a staunch monarchist and Christian, he believes that the present war began because of a spiritual schism and can only be ended by overcoming it.

Therefore, not long ago, Mongolia's largest city was occupied by a yellow garrison of one of the Chinese generals. Not all nomads agreed to such a position.

Therefore, not long ago, Mongolia's largest city was occupied by a yellow garrison of one of the Chinese generals. Not all nomads agreed to this position.

In some places the resistance to the Soviets was offered by officers, Cossacks, junkers and regiments, remaining loyal to the counterrevolutionary command, which led in particular to the bloody battles in Moscow. The establishment of Soviet power in a remote area like Russia beyond the Urals was hampered not only by poor communications, but also by the small number of workers. Although by virtue of their specific position (living from the sale of their labor force on the verge of death in the event of loss of work, the organization of labor in the army and the high cohesion of the collectives as a consequence) proletarians were the most politically active and revolutionary stratum, their small number interfered. \nWe got information that the 1st Chita Cossack regiment under the command of colonel Nikolay Komarovsky, who had returned from the front, went into Chita, disarmed the Red Guard, prevented arrest of the local administration, disbanded the Soviet and established there the power of "The People's Soviet" with the SR's staff standing on the anti-Bolshevik position."

Only three weeks remain until the elections to the Constituent Assembly, when the master of the Russian land, having assembled, could have his final word on everything that worries and offends you, that gives us hope and makes us believe in a bright future for Russia. And at this time, full of anxieties and expectations, the Bolsheviks encroached on the Supreme Power, knowing full well that a coup d'etat at this moment would bring the greatest confusion in Russia, already torn by party discord... Here is the answer to the seizure of supreme state power by the Bolsheviks: the Orenburg Cossack Host Government should take over the full measure of state power here, on place, in the Orenburg Cossack Host, so that the Host Government, relying on its older brothers, could defend the basic truths which are always and everywhere said: "Unanimity and order above all else. It was not vanity or a desire to shatter arms that impelled the Cossack government to this responsible and difficult step, but the only sincere intention to prevent fratricidal massacres here, in a place where all wide fields and steppes are native and close to us, where every bush we tillers have known since our childhood. We, the Voivoy government, shall give account to our Voivoy Circle and the lawful Russian government for our actions, and therefore we are guided by one single desire to save our dear land from ruin, from disorder, and we openly declare and shall prove in practice that until the restoration of the Supreme authority in lawful hands, we shall not allow any anarchy, any attempts to pogroms and other outrages. Cossacks, remember the cordons, remember how your wives and children were taken away to the steppes, you were on guard duty then, guarding Russia's outskirts, now it's time for the same thing: wives and children are not taken away, they are robbed and mercilessly killed not alone, but in gangs... Be in line in the regiment and at home! The Bolshevik movement did not stop. The host government, taking this into account, is faced with the difficult question of taking extreme measures, if the revolt spreads further. We may have to spill brotherly blood in defense of ourselves and the state, but we will fulfill our duty to the fatherland to the end. And we, the Cossack government appeal to you, dear cossacks: at our first call, be ready to close ranks and to break the anarchy, to break the flagrant desire to seize power from the right and the left, which is the apple of discord, which gives no rest day and night to those who covet it undeservedly. We Cossacks must lead the country to the Constituent Assembly. ... Those are not afraid of us, they know us and have seen in practice our loyalty to our country. Remember the Cossack blood, spilt at the hands of Bolsheviks on the streets of Petrograd on July 3-4, and you will understand what the Bolsheviks were in the days of freedom and what the Cossacks were in those days.

After capture of Donguz station I personally sent a delegate to look for Ataman Dutov with a request for help, but that help came to Ilyinskaya stanitsa, when I with my regiment was already in Orenburg; I haven't waited for help in due time, and it would be very necessary.

Put the last Cossack at the front, to spend the last ruble, but not to be reconciled with the traitors and ruiners of their native land. Declare to the Reds that the provinces and districts from which the Red Army units were formed will be responsible for the devastation of the stanitsa, and they will pay all the damages. Stanitsa, which did not suffer from the Bolsheviks, should help the devastated villages with all their wealth. \n2) To organize the economy of the army, because last year it was in a complete decline. The army is living in debt. A lot of money is spent unproductively and not economically. 3) Firmly and definitely express their opinion about the Supreme Government and adopt a certain line of behavior, because the vacillation in the views of the host government for the last six months damaged the army and the common cause. 4) Put honest, brave and certain people at the head of the army, who would not change their views, like a mill with its wings depending on the wind. \n5) To put an end to the undeserved elevation of officers known only for running away to Turgai, where they were eating up the army's money and did nothing to liberate the troops, and to give an opportunity for men of knowledge and experience to rise to the front of the army, not thinking only about ranks and salaries, but honestly doing their duty to the Motherland. \Nobody will encroach on our internal Cossack life and self-government, because there is no reason for this, and therefore the army can boldly connect with Siberia in the closest way and work together for a common cause.{nIn Kerensky's days... Ataman Dutov, being at that time chairman of the Union of Cossack Troops, strenuously sought the opportunity to be useful to him. At the time of Kornilov's speech, when the word of the Union of Cossack Troops could have a great influence on the Cossack regiments of the front, Ataman Dutov avoided a definite answer, but offered his services to the same Kerensky for negotiations with Kornilov. \n... In all his activity from the beginning to the end the only desire to exalt himself and his cronies at the expense even of the common cause prevailed and the results are obvious, such a split was created among the officers which can not be repaired soon and without officers the army can not fight. Knowing Ataman Dutov from my childhood and all his family, I declare calmly, without fear to spoil the truth, that he did the army much harm and very little good. Therefore I consider him unworthy to be an army ataman. If the Assembly does not like my frank opinion, I do not hesitate to exclude me from the estates of the army, but I consider it my duty to express it. There are some absolutely unprepared and incomprehensible members in the host government, they have to be replaced, but not in the way it has been done up to now, i.e. simply chosen, but preferably, an honest and trustworthy Army Ataman should choose his own assistants to the Government from the candidates proposed by the Army Circle, because he has to work with them, and he should know them and trust them...".

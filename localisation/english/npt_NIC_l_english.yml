 NIC_two_mafia_desc:0 "In Nicaragua, from its very foundation, a difficult situation developed, in the north, with the center in Leon, liberals settled, they became such because Leon was originally the center of Nicaraguan trade, where the entire bourgeoisie lived, which considered itself extremely progressive... In the south, with the center in Granada, conservatives settled, who became such due to the fact that in the south there is an extremely religious population, and also there are descendants of large Nicaraguan landowners. In common people they are called "the Leone and Granada mafias". Both of these factions are strongly conflating with each other, and depending on the ruling party, the capital was constantly transferred to Leon or Granada. "

 # EVENTS # Stepa, what are you yelling
 Nicaragua.1.t:0 "Cost reduction required "
 Nicaragua.1.d:0 "Recently, the Ministry of Finance announced that in order to pay off debts, it is necessary to reduce costs in huge quantities. We have two options: first, to abolish all social benefits and further increase taxes, as well as to begin to regulate prices for the population. The second option is to drastically reduce military spending, which will essentially completely destroy our defenses. \NSo, we have two options, so what kind of evil will we choose? "
 Nicaragua.1.a:0 "In these difficult times, ordinary citizens need to tighten their belts even tighter"
 Nicaragua.1.b:0 "The US must protect us, the cost of the army can be reduced"
 Nicaragua.2.t:0 "Workers' strike "

They demand the abolition of the tax increase, and some of them even demand the resignation of Vargas. They are not armed , so the police will have no trouble suppressing their rally. "
 Nicaragua.2.a:0 "Disperse these idiots"
 Nicaragua.3.t:0 "Autumn of the Patriarch"
 Nicaragua.3.d:0 "Our leader has been in power for so long that he no longer remembers how he came to it. He is both a man and a revived myth, and a puppeteer, and a puppet in the hands of the United States. He is completely alone in his huge palace, where the real and the unreal coexist in the most bizarre way. \NHe wants and fears death. But... is there death for the legend to come true? Perhaps the ruler will become happy only when he dies and realizes that for him the countless time of eternity is finally over? "

 Nicaragua.5.t:0 "Belt tightening"
 Nicaragua.5.d:0 "We have attracted the most highly qualified of our country in order to fight external debt, experts have come to a disappointing result, the only way to pay off external debt at this stage is to start saving. everybody might like it. All we have to do is wait and hope that all this will end quickly... "
 Nicaragua.5.a:0 "Hope this helps"
 Nicaragua.6.t:0 "Loans partially repaid "
 Nicaragua.6.d:0 "Finally, good news came, part of the loans were repaid. This is undoubtedly the best news in recent years, at such a pace we will sooner or later pay off all our debts, but we still have problems with taxes and bankruptcies but we have neither the time nor the resources to fix them. "
 Nicaragua.6.a:0 "Great news!"
 Nicaragua.7.t:0 "Ambassador arrived"
 Nicaragua.7.d:0 "Our ambassador has finally arrived in the United States and is ready to negotiate material assistance. We certainly know that the United States will provide us with everything we need, or at least part of the necessary, so that we can get out of debt. Perhaps this will finally appease liberals who want to end debt at any cost. "
 Nicaragua.7.a:0 "Welcome the guests!"
 Nicaragua.8.t:0 "Fifth Congress of the National Congress of Nicaragua"
 Nicaragua.8.d:0 "Annually in the capital of Nicaragua, Managua, the Congress of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is held, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Miguel Cardenas, appointed by Alfonso Diaz, and the President of the Senate, Pedro Gonzalez, announced the convention for June 14, 1917. Traditionally, two parties will be represented at the congress: liberals and conservatives. However, prior to the convention, the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate must be replaced, usually a month before the start of the convention. This year the situation will be tighter than usual, as the rumors are that the Liberals are ready to come up with a project to boycott American goods, and they are clearly determined to be independent from the United States. "
 Nicaragua.8.a:0 "Let's see"

The decrees of May 11, 1913 and June 5, 1914, which established a tax on deforestation and whose application was temporarily suspended from March 15, 1915, will enter into force again, but only in relation to forests cut for export in national or private forests after 15 June 1917, and those that will be exported after October 31, 1917. \n3. The tax rate will be increased to four Nicaraguan cordobas for every 1,000 feet of natural cedar, mahogany, oak and other wood species used in joinery, two cordobas for every 1,000 hawthorn, pine and other species used for construction, one cordoba per thousand feet of timber\n4. Wood harvested for consumption in the republic is not subject to payment of this tax. \n5. This tax will be collected in accordance with the procedure established by the executive branch. \n6.

 Nicaragua.10.t:0 "Change of President in Congress"
 Nicaragua.10.d:0 "Today, [GetDateStringNoHour], the new President of the Chamber of Deputies will be announced as well as the new President of the Senate. Since a little more than a month later, the fifth congress of deputies will open, it would not hurt us to put our man in the presidency of the congress, and just by the way, we turned up a distant relative from the Chamorro family, Salvador Chamorro. The only problem is that he is almost unpopular in Congress, but with the help of some political maneuvers, we can put him on the post of President of the National Congress. The only drawback is that if everything is revealed, the liberals will be clearly unhappy with the fact that we put our people in leadership positions for no reason. So far, all you need to do is sign a decree appointing Chamorro as president of the Chamber of Deputies.."
 Nicaragua.10.a:0 "I will issue a decree"
 Nicaragua.10.b:0 "Don't risk your reputation"
 Nicaragua.11.t:0 "Start of the annual Nicaraguan convention"
 Nicaragua.11.d:0 "It's time for the Common Caraguan Congress of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Two parties: conservatives and liberals, traditionally clash with each other, and although usually the results of the debates are predetermined in advance by the most democratic system in the world, this time the real oppositionists broke away from the "correct" liberals, demanding that the United States leave Nicaragua. This is a very bold statement, which the United States really does not approve of at all, so we need to get support at this congress in order to overcome the opposition. It is very difficult to do it on our own, but we can do it, right? "
 Nicaragua.11.a:0 "Oh Lord, crush this opposition,"

 NIC_up_taxes:0 "Increase taxes"
 NIC_up_taxes_desc:0 "If we want to pay off loans peacefully - we need to raise taxes, this is only the first step to solving the problem, but it is necessary, you also need to understand that sooner or later we will have to make sacrifices, but they still understand that they are worth it, yes ? "
 NIC_debauchery_end:0 "End of debauchery"
 NIC_debauchery_end_desc:0 "Raising taxes did not help us, but only exacerbated the problem. We need to take austerity measures and stop the debauchery and licentiousness of the population.

 NIC_lie_threats:0 "Blackmail and deception"
 NIC_lie_threats_desc:0 "Severe times call for harsh measures, banditry is pus, and all bandits are unworthy to exist... but everyone has a chance for redemption. Say, if we order them to speak, promising immunity, while simultaneously taking away all their property, then we will receive a lot of money. Yes, this is not fair, but the concept of honor is unacceptable for our situation. "

Otherwise, a political crisis may begin, which is not far from the semblance of a civil war. Many people call this system a dual power, which is not far from the truth. What's even closer to the truth is that these "parties" are also called the mafia, and for this reason their "political capital" is not so much dependent on the real support of the population."
 NIC_new_duties:0 "Leone Trade Duties"
 NIC_new_duties_desc:0 "After the announcement of the so-called "Notes of Vargas", which says that the country must deal with its foreign debt at any cost.

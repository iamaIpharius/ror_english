 ireland.1.t_1:0 "Second Easter?"
 ireland.1.d:0 "Terrible news comes to us from Dublin! Some time ago a rebellion began in Ireland. The 73 members of the English Parliament, declaring themselves the plenipotentiary Parliament of Ireland, adopted a declaration of the sovereignty of Ireland, proclaiming an Irish Republic, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of British troops from the newly proclaimed state. A provisional Irish republican government was formed. Our administration refused to comply with the demands of the rebels and opened fire on the rebels. Fighting is going on in the cities, but it is unlikely that local forces are sufficient to defeat the traitors. Moreover, the rank and file of the Irish in our troops have learned of this! They refuse to go on the attack, and some of them are even agitating for armed insurrection! Of course, we are trying to resolve the matter, but we can't conduct military operations now..."

The 73 members of the English Parliament, declaring themselves the plenipotentiary Parliament of Ireland, adopted a declaration of the sovereignty of Ireland, proclaiming an Irish Republic, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of British troops from the territory of the newly proclaimed state. A provisional Irish republican government was formed. Our administration refused to comply with the demands of the rebels and opened fire on the rebels. Fighting is going on in the cities, but it is unlikely that local forces are enough to defeat the traitors. It's a good thing we've purged the front-line troops of potential insurgents. Who knows what would have happened if the Irish had stayed on the front lines?"
 ireland.1.a:0 "The green hills will be sprinkled with blood..."
 ireland.1.b:0 "We ourselves!"
 ireland.2.t:0 "Sing, revolution!"
 ireland.2.d:0 "Finally, after all these years, independence is closer than ever. Sinn Féin, a conglomerate of generally all political forces advocating the country's independence, has already begun to form an interim government of 73 deputies declaring national sovereignty. But many fear a repeat of Bloody Easter 1916 and are hesitant. We must not fail now!"
 ireland.2.a:0 "Will and reason will lead us to victory!"
 ireland.3.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 1 of 12."
 ireland.3.d:0 "Originally, Sinn Féin was the collective name for all the forces advocating Irish independence from British rule. By the outbreak of the World War, however, it had emerged as a conventionally unified political party. After the Bloody Easter of 1916, its leadership decided to create a fighting wing of the party, which was called the Irish Republican Army, similar to the defeated Irish Republican Brotherhood.nnThe Irish Civil Army is a relatively old paramilitary socialist grouping, one of the few organizations that survived the Bloody Easter. Although its membership never exceeded 150, it has considerable influence and serves more as a symbol for the common people and enjoys popularity. For some time Sinn Féin pondered a possible alliance, but this could have greatly increased the influence of the left, given that socialist ideas had also begun to spread among IRA commanders and soldiers. In the end, of course, they decided...."
 ireland.3.a:0 "Reorganize the IRA."
 ireland.3.b:0 "Cooperate with the IRA"
 ireland.4.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 2 of 12."
 ireland.4.d:0 "The Irish Volunteers were a volunteer paramilitary organization that maintained order in Ireland and served as part of Kitchener's "New Army" in the fields of the World War. The Easter Rising forced London to recall them. The movement is largely composed of apolitical Irishmen who are only interested in the order and well-being of their town or village. \nThe Irish Parliamentary Party is one of the largest political forces that seeks to expand Irish self-government through peaceful means, such as parliamentary struggle. Nevertheless, it is not opposed to more radical measures, although most of its members do not like the final rupture. However, it has quite a few retired officers and a coalition with the PPI looks tempting... \nIn the end, Sinn Féin has decided to take up..."

 ireland.5.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 3 of 12."
 ireland.5.d:0 "Attitudes toward the 1916 rebellion in Ireland itself varied widely. Of course, many recognize it as a turning point in history, but assessments are very, very different... For some, the rebels are freedom fighters and heroes. For others, they are troublemakers and traitors to the friendly British family. Whatever the assessment, however, they are also seasoned guerrillas who have spent much of their time fighting against the Crown and know their tactics and habits well. Their rescue would have allowed the rebellion to be far more successful, but it would have alienated Sinn Féin from more moderate forces and destabilized an already turbulent political environment. As a result, the leadership decided to..."
 ireland.5.a:0 "To campaign against the British."
 ireland.5.b:0 "Rescue the rebels from the camps."
 ireland.6.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 4 of 12."
 ireland.6.d:0 "Few revolutions and uprisings succeed without support from abroad. But even with it, the success of the rebellion is not guaranteed, as was demonstrated in the winter of 1916, when the Irish relied heavily on German support, which, however, did not come. The Irish separatist movement, however, was always fueled by someone: mainly by the wealthy descendants of the Irish who had left for the New World. However, some leftists in the organization proposed to cooperate with the world communist movement. Of course, the Second International is highly discredited and, in fact, doesn't work, but the Zimmerwald alliance might well serve our purposes... Though, of course, it would then strengthen the position of the Communists in the ranks of Sinn Féin.However, support has been obtained..."
 ireland.6.a:0 "From across the ocean."
 ireland.6.b:0 "From the Zimmerwald Line."
 ireland.7.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 5 of 12."
 ireland.7.d:0 "Historically, Arthur Griffith, a national liberal and a supporter of cooperation with Britain, is considered the founder and head of Sinn Féin. He wanted independence for the country, but saw a complete break with Britain as ruinous and advocated dominion status for his homeland. This position conflicted with the influential national-conservative Eamon de Valera, who sought to create a fully independent Great Ireland that would be free from British influence. During one of their conventions their conflict reached a peak and the radicals demanded the re-election of the leader of the party. It became..."

 ireland.8.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 6 of 12."
 ireland.8.d:0 "Ulster is the stronghold of the British Empire on the Continent. It is these six counties of the North that serve as the main political base of the Unionists. Moreover, for several centuries they had already begun to lose their Irish identity by considering themselves British! Of course, recognizing Ulster's right to self-determination would endear us to the people, but perhaps we should not tear apart our already small island and scattered nation?"
 ireland.8.a:0 "Recognize Ulster self-determination."
 ireland.8.b:0 "Ireland is United and Indivisible!"
 ireland.9.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 7 of 12."
 ireland.9.d:0 "The Irish Republican Army strongly gravitates toward leftist views. First of all, this is justified by the fact that, unlike the Democrats and the Nationalists, the men in arms do not want any connection with the oppressor and enslaver in the person of the British Crown. And only socialists and communists have also radically opposed the greatest of monarchies. In this regard, a number of commanders have repeatedly appealed to the leadership of Sinn Féin to proclaim the so-called "class struggle" to emphasize that they are fighting not just for the freedom of the country, but for the freedom of the people from exploitation and the world's greatest exploiter. On the other hand, this would make our party even more leftist and would surely lead to an even greater split between the left and right wings..."
 ireland.9.a:0 "Proclaim a national struggle!"
 ireland.9.b:0 "Proclaim the class struggle!"
 ireland.10.t:0 "Sinn Féin's Story. Part 8 of 12."
 ireland.10.d:0 "Sinn Féin is certainly the most radical mass party in Ireland, of those who advocate independence, but even it has a moderate wing which is disposed to cooperate with the British, not to mention several personalities who are willing even to be "dominionists" in the Empire. In one way or another, it has a certain influence on the whole party. \nThis very wing once made a proposal to create an official militia along the lines of the Irish Volunteers, but less militarized and more massive. In fact, they proposed to persuade the governor to transfer police functions to the Irish themselves. On the other hand, one could once again abandon attempts to cooperate with the British and continue the glorious tradition of terror..."

 ireland.10.b:0 "Form a militia."
 ireland.11.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 9 of 12."
 ireland.11.d:0 "Bloody Easter still echoes with pain. It is a wound on the Irish people. A mass rebellion that the British punished cruelly. But without the support of the people, the war is doomed to fail. However... Part of the nationalists suggest that we give the British hell by attacking them in small groups and annoying the British government in every possible way. They propose that we should switch to guerrilla and terrorist methods. But wouldn't it be better to end British domination all at once?"
 ireland.11.a:0 "Bet on the revolt of the masses."
 ireland.11.b:0 "Bet on guerrillaism and terrorism."
 ireland.12.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 10 of 12."
 ireland.12.d:0 "This may come as a surprise to some, but there are forces in Britain itself that support peoples' right to self-determination. Often, however, they regard Ireland as part of the metropolis. Ireland is only recognized as separate from Britain by communists and other leftists... Perhaps we should contact them and ask them to support us.
 ireland.12.a:0 "No ties to the British!"
 ireland.12.b:0 "Request support from the British Left."
 ireland.13.t:0 "Sinn Féin's Story. Part 11 of 12."
 ireland.13.d:0 "Shortly before the revolution there was a debate within the party about how to prepare for that revolution. The IRA commanders insisted on continuing secret preparations so as to crush the British in one blow. Even though our forces were smaller than the British, we were in a position to achieve a considerable superiority in certain parts of the terrain. On the other hand, the reformist wing of Sinn Féin insisted on organizing a riot, so that the British authorities would understand that a second uprising, which would be truly general, Britain could not drown in blood. In the end, it was decided...."
 ireland.13.a:0 "Continue to prepare the rebellion."
 ireland.13.b:0 "Take to the streets!"
 ireland.14.t:0 "The Story of Sinn Féin. Part 12 of 12."
 ireland.14.d:0 "Just before the uprising, the right wing of our party introduced the issue of ideological training for IRA soldiers and commanders. According to them, there are too many left-liberal elements in their ranks. Some even accuse the leaders of our revolutionary army of preparing a coup! So they propose, just before the uprising, to inspect and establish the institution of military commissars in order to tightly control our armed forces. In the end, the party has decided...."
 ireland.14.a:0 "Continue the expansion of the IRA."
 ireland.14.b:0 "Introduce political-ideological control."
 ireland.15.t:0 "Limerick Soviet"
 ireland.15.d:0 "Surprising news comes from the county of Limerick. In response to the restrictive measures of the authorities and the declaration of the city as a special zone, with the result that entry into the city limits was permitted only by passes (and almost all workers lived behind it), the Limerick Soviet of Trade Unions went on a general strike, which, unexpectedly, was supported even by factory and factory owners. Even the police supported the workers' action! Soon the local authorities surrendered all their powers to the local Soviet, which proclaimed the establishment of the Soviet Republic of Limerick."
 ireland.15.a:0 "Is this some kind of joke?"
 ireland.15.b:0 "Freedom to the workers and peasants!"
 ireland.16.t:0 "Dissolution of Limerick Soviet."
 ireland.16.d:0 "The sudden victory of the Communists in Limerick ended much more expectedly in the self-dissolution of the Soviet as a result of negotiations with the central authorities. The red rags are put away, the banners burned, and the county returns to its usual pace of life. It seems we are no longer in danger of a socialist revolution..."
 ireland.16.a:0 "And what was that?"
 ireland.17.t:0 "The Red Menace!"
 ireland.17.d:0 "We have been wrong to underestimate events in Limerick. A week later, the local Soviet contacted the Communists in our army and party, with the result that they decided to make a socialist revolution right in the middle of liberation from Britain! And most disgusting of all, many of our soldiers supported the leftists! Worker and peasant militias are gathering all over Ireland. Can we beat them?"
 ireland.17.a:0 "Crush the traitors!"
 ireland.17.b:0 "Sing, revolution!"
 ireland.18.t:0 "Negotiate with Britain?"
 ireland.18.d:0 "The Green Island is finally almost freed from the shackles of tyranny! Only the six northern counties remain. It must be remembered, however, that the locals are not very sympathetic to the ideas of breaking with Britain. Quite frankly, they want to remain part of the Empire. The Unionists in our ranks suggest an armistice with Britain. Of course, in this case we will not achieve full and final independence and will remain under a certain influence of the Crown, but we will decide our own fate. The Nationalists, on the other hand, are demanding a final offensive and the final crushing of Britain."
 ireland.18.a:0 "We are free enough."
 ireland.18.b:0 "To the victorious end!"
 ireland.19.t:0 "That sweet smell of freedom..."
 ireland.19.d:0 "Finally, the last stronghold of the hated occupiers has fallen. We have taken no prisoners. There are no more Britons. London has already sent an envoy to us to negotiate peace and we know how it will end - they will simply recognize the blood won freedom. Of course, we will be under an economic blockade, and our economy is already suffering the negative consequences of the break with the British, but for freedom Ireland is willing to do anything."
 ireland.19.a:0 "Breathe as if for the last time."
 ireland.20.t:0 "The Nationalists are sowing confusion..."
 ireland.20.d:0 "The latest party debate has exposed all the contradictions between factions in Sinn Féin. The conflict between the two leaders threatens to split the country. Eamon de Valera, nationalist and right-wing leader, accuses Arthur Griffith, leader of the moderates, of treachery and weakness. De Valera demands the continuation of the war and complete freedom. His supporters refused to ratify the Anglo-Irish treaty and left the meeting in protest. Across the country, IRA commanders are choosing which side to take..."
 ireland.20.a:0 "Crush the traitors!"
 ireland.20.b:0 "Rotten Roots Rip Out!"
 ireland.21.t:0 "Nationalists are sowing confusion..."
 ireland.21.d:0 "At an extraordinary party congress, Arthur Griffith demanded a cessation of hostilities and a truce with Britain, criticizing Eamon de Valera for excessive nationalism and the destruction of the national economy. Nevertheless, most Sinn Fein members, and later MPs, supported de Valera in the war until the end, with the result that Griffith and his supporters announced their withdrawal from the party and the creation of a new one. Across the country, IRA commanders are choosing which side to take..."
 ireland.21.a:0 "Just trash."

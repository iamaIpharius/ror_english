 rcw_muscovy.1.desc:0 "Nikolay Evgenievich Markov was a prominent political figure. The head of the largest pro-government party, the Union of the Russian People, and one of the famous Duma speakers of the monarchist wing. However, his political ability could do little in the face of strong internal instability. It was impossible to restore exactly the same pre-revolutionary government so that the same shortcomings did not arise in the country. Markov understood this, so he decided to give authority to a more experienced person. From now on, Aleksey Mikhailovich Khvostov, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, will take over the full power."

The German emperor was not satisfied with the reduction of the official title. The ceremony did not at all resemble the same as in 1896: no large masses of people, no festivities after. But the most terrible thing was the withdrawal of the imperial title, made, according to the Kaiser, "before the restoration of sovereignty over all the lands of the Russian crown." From now on,Nikolay Romanov, although he retained the account of inheritance, was only the Tsar of Moscow and other..."

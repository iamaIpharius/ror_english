 rcw_bfk.1.t:0 "Demarche of Estonians".
 rcw_bfk.1.d:0 "The Provisional Land Soviet of the Province of Estonia did not recognize the legitimacy of the SovNarCom and at its last meeting proclaimed itself the supreme power for the period until the Constitutional Soviet was convened. They declare neutrality in the Soviet-German conflict."
 rcw_bfk.1.a:0 "The Zemskiy Soviet must be dissolved."
 rcw_bfk.1.b:0 "The temporary buffer does not prevent us."
 rcw_bfk.2.t:0 "Attitude towards Estonian statehood"
 rcw_bfk.2.d:0 "The Provisional Zemstvo Soviet of the Province of Estonia has recently separated from revolutionary Russia, but it has virtually no troops. This is a good chance to advance in the eastern direction."
 rcw_bfk.2.a:0 "Let's take back the Teutonic lands."
 rcw_bfk.2.b:0 "Now an invasion of Estonia is not desirable."
 rcw_bfk.3.t:0 "Create Estonian People's Army"
 rcw_bfk.3.d:0 "The young Estonian state has begun the creation of a volunteer army. We hope to recruit enough volunteers to ensure the security of the country."
 rcw_bfk.3.a:0 "Join the People's Army!"
 rcw_bfk.4.t:0 "German Invasion."
 rcw_bfk.4.d:0 "Contrary to our expectations, German units decided not to support our government in fighting Russian tyranny, but to occupy our country by establishing their own orders."
 rcw_bfk.4.a:0 "This is what we need!"
 rcw_bfk.4.b:0 "No!"
 
 rcw_bfk.7.t:0 "The outcome of the mobilization."
 rcw_bfk.7.d:0 "Recruitment was not effective enough and from now on we will move to universal conscription. However, the backbone of the army is established and ready for battle."
 rcw_bfk.7.a:0 "Excellent."
 rcw_bfk.8.t:0 "Aid to kindred people."
 rcw_bfk.8.d:0 "Heavy fighting with the red gangs has broken out in Estonia. Many feel that we are obliged to help the Estonians with arms and equipment, and many are ready to go into battle themselves."
 rcw_bfk.8.a:0 "Send volunteers and supply them with weapons."
 rcw_bfk.8.b:0 "Send a convoy with weapons."
 rcw_bfk.8.c:0 "This is not our war."
 rcw_bfk.9.t:0 "Progress in Estonia"
 rcw_bfk.9.d:0 "The Red Army together with the Estonian Communists occupied Narva. A Provisional Revolutionary Committee has been formed in the city, which wishes to form the Estonian Workers' Commune."
 rcw_bfk.9.a:0 "Long live the Commune!"
 rcw_bfk.9.b:0 "Splitting is unacceptable."
 rcw_bfk.10.t:0 "Threat from the South"
 rcw_bfk.10.d:0 "There is a German-Russian uprising in neighboring Latvia right now. The Latvians have no serious forces to repel the threat, and meanwhile the rebels are heavily armed veterans of the best armies. Neither the Germans nor the Russians in this corps recognize the Baltic states and apparently aim to occupy the entire region."
 rcw_bfk.10.a:0 "Defeat the enemy on foreign territory."
 rcw_bfk.10.b:0 "Our soldiers will not die for Riga"
 
 rcw_bfk.11.t:0 "Latvia is defenseless."
 rcw_bfk.11.d:0 "Now with the declaration of war we clearly see that our borders are defenseless. Latvia is practically devoid of armed forces. However, there is hope for a hasty mobilization and participation of German troops. Mobilization can be dangerous in the sense that too many Latvians sympathize with the Reds. The Germans are dangerous in the sense that they think they are the masters of Latvia, and until recently they really were. The Germans hate the Bolsheviks and the Latvians equally and therefore they are more combat worthy than our conscripts, but for their services the Germans will demand land."
 rcw_bfk.11.a:0 "Our support is in our citizens!"
 rcw_bfk.11.b:0 "After the war, German soldiers receive allotments... After... "
 rcw_bfk.11.c:0 "We need all available forces."
 rcw_bfk.12.t:0 "Revolt in the troops."
 rcw_bfk.12.d:0 "Our new conscripts were not conscientious enough citizens. Latvians rioting against their government - what a shame! In any case, there is a problem and it must be gotten rid of."
 rcw_bfk.12.a:0 "Use force."
 rcw_bfk.12.b:0 "Propaganda will calm the fighters. Latvia is no empty sound for a patriot!"
 rcw_bfk.13.t:0 "S.-d. leave the People's Soviet"
 rcw_bfk.13.d:0 "The Social-Democrats were dissatisfied with the government's cooperation with the German administration and demonstratively left the Soviet. But what are they thinking? The Germans will come and go, but the Reds will stay!"
 rcw_bfk.13.a:0 "Fools."
 rcw_bfk.14.t:0 "The Ghost of Defeat"
 rcw_bfk.14.d:0 "Military operations are going extremely badly for our army. The government believes that if we have reserves, they must be urgently activated or we will be left without a country."
 rcw_bfk.14.a:0 "We have no choice - we'll ask the Germans for help."
 rcw_bfk.14.b:0 "As we see, no one but Latvians will protect Latvia!"
 rcw_bfk.14.c:0 "Hope only on propaganda"
 rcw_bfk.15.t:0 "The deplorable situation in Latvia"
 rcw_bfk.15.d:0 "The recently seceded Baltic state of Latvia is now a victim of the Bolshevik Revolution. But that is not the main point. Courland and a large German population have become part of Latvia. The German Landwehrs are fighting the Reds without support. Can we abandon our blood brothers?"
 rcw_bfk.15.a:0 "We cannot help... But let us not hinder the gathering of volunteers."
 rcw_bfk.15.b:0 "We can't help."
 rcw_bfk.16.t:0 "German Coup."
 rcw_bfk.16.d:0 "A Landeswehr strike force under Lieutenant Hans von Manteifel disarmed the Latvian guards, carried out a coup, and dispersed the Latvian Provisional Government. Ulmanis fled to the steamer "Saratov". The whole government could not be arrested, but it would do nothing more."
 rcw_bfk.16.a:0 "We will have to follow the German course."
 rcw_bfk.17.t:0 "Unreliable army."
 rcw_bfk.17.d:0 "In spite of the success of our troops, times are not yet better for our government. There are many Latvian units in the army fighting for us as we are fighting the Reds. As soon as victory is final, the specter of Latvian nationalism will arise again."
 rcw_bfk.17.a:0 "Strike pre-emptively."
 rcw_bfk.17.b:0 "Now is not the time."
 rcw_bfk.18.t:0 "Western Russian Army."
 rcw_bfk.18.d:0 "The territory of Latvia is practically cleared of German rebels, but many of them are now being converted to the so-called Western Volunteer Army organized by the Russian officer Bermondt-Avalov. This organization is allegedly preparing to fight the Bolsheviks and march to the Russian front. We can now give Avalov an ultimatum, which will obviously complicate relations not so much with the Germans as with the Russians."
 rcw_bfk.18.a:0 "A decree should be issued to dissolve the ZDA."
 rcw_bfk.18.b:0 "Keep an eye on them."
 rcw_bfk.19.t:0 "Speech by Avalov"
 rcw_bfk.19.d:0 "The Western Russian Army has come into motion. Its commander demands that the troops be allowed to move freely. It is worth recalling that Bermond-Avalov has never recognized the Latvian government, is surrounded by German officers and has his own pocket government in addition. We can reinforce the garrisons and monitor the transportation of the ZDA, but perhaps it is better to simply forbid it."
 rcw_bfk.19.a:0 "One less problem."
 rcw_bfk.19.b:0 "Go to the front when we say so."
 rcw_bfk.20.t:0 "Further Politics"
 rcw_bfk.20.d:0 "Bunch of local nationalists and gangs of Reds are finally driven from our land. However, the neighboring states show no friendliness to our government. It is known that most of Ulmanis' troops have moved to Estonia, and Lithuania is strengthening the units on the border with us every day!"
 rcw_bfk.20.a:0 "We will not fight on two fronts again."
 rcw_bfk.20.b:0 "We need a good plan to solve these problems."
 rcw_bfk.20.c:0 "We will strike first, in the best Prussian tradition."
 
 rcw_bfk.21.t:0 "Latvian self-determination"
 rcw_bfk.21.d:0 "Using self-determination slogans, bourgeois Latvian nationalists proclaim Latvian self-determination. The Germans can use this fact in the negotiations to pressure and under this pretext move troops further to Pskov. It might make sense to be ahead of the curve and proclaim revolutionary Latvian statehood."
 rcw_bfk.21.a:0 "Let us hand over power to the local Soviet organs..."
 rcw_bfk.21.b:0 "The nationalists have no chance."
 
 rcw_bfk.22.t:0 "Question of the Republic of Iscolat"
 rcw_bfk.22.d:0 "During negotiations, the Bolsheviks created a buffer Latvian state on Baltic territory under their control. Now that the Russians have gone, it is of no use and will be easily crushed by our troops."
 rcw_bfk.22.a:0 "Start offensive."
 rcw_bfk.22.b:0 "Dispersing forces now makes no sense."
 
 rcw_bfk.23.t:0 "Liberate the Baltics"
 rcw_bfk.23.d:0 "The lands of the Baltics are again united by the German hand! The time will come and they will return to their native harbor, now it is up to us to arrange the state machine and choose a new course of development."
 rcw_bfk.23.a:0 "The Duchy of the Baltics will be revived."
 rcw_bfk.23.b:0 "We should be more careful."
 
 rcw_bfk.25.t:0 "Parachute Saratov"
 rcw_bfk.25.d:0 "There has been a coup in Latvia by a group of German officers. Ulmanis has left on a steamboat for the Baltic Sea. The Ostseians are clearly preparing to re-establish baronial power throughout the Baltics. We have the men and weapons to prevent this. Besides, the Latvians and Ulmanis themselves will gladly accept our help."
 rcw_bfk.25.a:0 "No recognition for the puppets of the landlords of Courland!"
 rcw_bfk.25.b:0 "Estonian soldiers will not die for Ulmanis."
 
 rcw_bfk.26.t:0 "Meeting the Landwehr"
 rcw_bfk.26.d:0 "We managed to learn about German troops approaching our borders. German landlords once kept the Baltic peasants in want. Now in Courland the Germans have been able to assemble their own militia, and there is no doubt that, having established a puppet regime in Latvia, they will proceed to invade Estonia."
 rcw_bfk.26.a:0 "Strike first."
 rcw_bfk.26.b:0 "We must prepare forces."
 
 rcw_bfk.27.t:0 "Return Ulmanis"
 rcw_bfk.27.d:0 "The German Landwehr could not stand the encounter with Latvia's loyal patriots. Niedra packed his bags and fled, the command is ready to sign an armistice and hand power back to Ulmanis. He solemnly returns from exile on the steamer "Saratov."
 rcw_bfk.27.a:0 "Glory to the Force!"
 
 rcw_bfk.28.t:0 "The Return of Ulmanis."
 rcw_bfk.28.d:0 "The German Landwehr could not stand the encounter with the Estonian army and loyal Latvian patriots. Niedra packed his bags and fled, the command is ready to sign an armistice and hand over power back to Ulmanis. He solemnly returns from exile on the steamer "Saratov"."
 rcw_bfk.28.a:0 "Glory to the Force!"
 
 rcw_bfk.32.t:0 "The Land Question."
 rcw_bfk.32.d:0 "After confiscating the land of the landlords, we must decide what to do with it: to form state farms, state agricultural enterprises where employees work for wages, or to distribute land to the people, which may lead to more frequent cases of soldiers going home."
 rcw_bfk.32.a:0 "Give them away to the Latvians."
 rcw_bfk.32.b:0 "We cannot allow soldiers to scatter, organize state farms."
 
 rcw_bfk.104.t:0 "Treaty with the Northern Corps"
 rcw_bfk.104.d:0 "Russian troops formed by the German administration remain on Estonian territory. It is possible to seek their help to strengthen the young people's army."
 rcw_bfk.104.a:0 "The Northern Corps will become part of the Estonian army."
 
 rcw_bfk.105.t:0 "Northern Corps Delegation"
 rcw_bfk.105.d:0 "After the success of the offensive and entering enemy territory, the command of the Russian Northern Corps approached us. They wish to form an independent administration and army to continue the struggle for the liberation of their homeland."
 rcw_bfk.105.a:0 "We are not interested in that."
 rcw_bfk.105.b:0 "We will be safer without them."
 rcw_bfk.105.c:0 "For a free Russia!"
 
 rcw_bfk.106.t:0 "Choosing a strategy"
 rcw_bfk.106.d:0 "The fighting is progressing rapidly. We need to weigh all the factors of our situation and choose our next course of action. Our army is sparse, should we rush to Petrograd now, or should we move forward in stages, looking for weaknesses in the enemy's defenses."
 rcw_bfk.106.a:0 "We should quickly occupy the capital."
 rcw_bfk.106.b:0 "A broad sweep is necessary.
 rcw_bfk.107.t:0 "Behind Enemy Lines"
 rcw_bfk.107.d:0 "After establishing a strong connection with the National Center and the Union for the Defense of the Motherland and Freedom, we have received extensive information about what is happening in the Northwest behind the Red Forces. We became aware of underground officers' organizations sympathetic to us and of the unrest among the peasantry. Both of these factors can be used to weaken the red front, but everything must be paid for."
 rcw_bfk.107.a:0 "Officers must rise up and come over to our side."
 rcw_bfk.107.b:0 "It's worth supporting the peasants, even though it's not our way."
 rcw_bfk.107.c:0 "Don't be petty."
 rcw_bfk.108.t:0 "Savinkov Program"
 rcw_bfk.108.d:0 "After a long period of 'Undecideds,' the government has finally chosen a certain course of action. It became the so-called "Savinkov Program," which encapsulated national principles, the establishment of a connection with the labor strata, democracy, including grassroots democracy, and, of course, fierce anti-Bolshevism. The main body of government is envisaged to be the People's Veche, and the army will be replenished by peasants. Now our friends and enemies know exactly what kind of Russia we are fighting for. In connection with the change of policy there is a question of changing the leadership. Perhaps it is too early to invite the author of the program to the Northwest."
 rcw_bfk.108.a:0 "Write to Savinkov immediately."
 rcw_bfk.108.b:0 "You're right, we should wait."
 rcw_bfk.109.t:0 "[NWA.GetNameDef] ready to recognize Finland"
 rcw_bfk.109.d:0 "We have received a diplomatic offer from the Russian White Army in the Baltics. This government is ready to recognize us officially, and although it is not an all-Russian government, a treaty with it would obviously serve as a good guarantee. In return, however, the Russians demand a diversionary strike - they are quite willing to accept a limited scale operation. It is worth noting that now the Finnish people are still divided and the return of Karelia is the dream of many of our patriots. There seems to be an opportunity to please everyone."
 rcw_bfk.109.a:0 "For our and your freedom!"
 rcw_bfk.109.b:0 "We have just recovered from the war..."
 rcw_bfk.113.t:0 "Liberation of the capital."
 rcw_bfk.113.d:0 "Rejoice Russian people! Petrograd, the goal of our campaign, has been reached. The enemies have been cut off from the Baltic Sea and are withdrawing into the interior of the country. And now we must have time to get the maximum political benefit from this situation, both for the entire movement and for ourselves in particular."
 rcw_bfk.113.a:0 "Target accomplished - handing over power to the Russian government."
 rcw_bfk.113.b:0 "Announce the convening of the Constituent Assembly of the Northwest."
 rcw_bfk.113.c:0 "Urgently draft a response to Kirill Vladimirovich "
 
 rcw_bfk.121.t:0 "Proposal of the Northwest Army Command"
 rcw_bfk.121.d:0 "The general staff of the NWA is making suggestions about the need to combine forces operationally. The Northerners enjoy close contacts with the German command and have obtained its full consent to such a move."
 rcw_bfk.121.a:0 "Unification is a step toward victory."
 rcw_bfk.121.b:0 "We have our own Chiefs."
 rcw_bfk.122.t:0 "The Russian Threat"
 rcw_bfk.122.d:0 "The former generals and officers of the Russian imperial army who organized a new army in the Baltics to fight the revolutionaries have now turned their bayonets against our government. They demand unquestioning obedience and essentially annexation."
 rcw_bfk.122.a:0 "So war!"
 rcw_bfk.122.b:0 "We made ourselves a nation for nothing..."
 rcw_bfk.123.t:0 "A great day for the Baltics"
 rcw_bfk.123.d:0 "All lands liberated and united. But the army is too tired. Germans and natives are going home, fewer and fewer Russians believe in the possibility of defeating Bolshevism now. \nWe need to arrange a real state life on our territory and first of all choose a form of government."
 rcw_bfk.123.a:0 "Monarchical beginning."
 rcw_bfk.123.b:0 "Republican system."
 
 rcw_bfk.125.t:0 "Rebellion of Fort Red Mountain"
 rcw_bfk.125.d:0 "There were quite a few former Czarist officers serving in the forts. At Fort Krasnaya Gorka they organized a rebellion against the Reds in order to join with the Northwestern White Army."
 rcw_bfk.125.a:0 "Traitors to the Fatherland!"
 
 rcw_bfk.158.t:0 "Assignment of command to the NWO."
 rcw_bfk.158.d:0 "The liberated territory of the Northwest finally has its own government, but its head has not yet been chosen. The general consensus is that one of our illustrious generals should be the dictator, at least until Petrograd is taken. Now the head of the army is [NWA.GetLeader], but another equally bright candidate is also present."
 rcw_bfk.158.d_1:0 "Our leadership has recognized the Northwest Volunteer Army. It is now led by [NWA.GetLeader], but another equally bright candidate is present."
 rcw_bfk.158.a:0 "Experienced Yudenich."
 rcw_bfk.158.b:0 "The talented Rodzianko."
 rcw_bfk.160.t:0 "Russians Asking for Troops"
 rcw_bfk.160.d:0 "The Russian troops in the Baltics have already appealed to us for support, but they have decided to appeal again. Now the leaders of the SZA are asking for troops directly. Should we lose soldiers in someone else's Civil War?"
 rcw_bfk.160.a:0 "Need to get involved in defeating Bolshevism."
 rcw_bfk.160.b:0 "This is not our war."
 
 rcw_bfk.163.t:0 "Decree on the creation of the Lithuanian army"
 rcw_bfk.163.d:0 "The Lithuanian government had no plans to participate in the war and initially intended only to create a militia and do without armed forces. However, external circumstances and tensions in the region forced [GetDateText] Vilnius to issue a decree to start forming a Lithuanian army. However, this process is sure to drag on - the country is ravaged by war, people don't want to fight, and all weapons have been taken out by the numerous occupiers. But we will survive! The Lithuanian national spirit is strong!"
 rcw_bfk.163.a:0 "Obligatory."
 rcw_bfk.164.t:0 "Support Germany?"
 rcw_bfk.164.d:0 "We are short on weapons, men, and supplies. It is unlikely that we can stand up to our enemy. There is a view that we need to send a delegation to Berlin to get their support with arms and volunteers to defend our country. As sad as it is to admit, we are now only a buffer between East and West..."
 rcw_bfk.164.a:0 "After all, they gave us freedom."
 rcw_bfk.164.b:0 "We can handle ourselves!"
 rcw_bfk.165.t:0 "A request from Lithuania."
 rcw_bfk.165.d:0 "A delegation came to us from Vilnius asking for people and weapons to fight for their freedom. Is it worth the expense, especially now when every man counts?"
 rcw_bfk.165.a:0 "Definitely."
 rcw_bfk.165.b:0 "It's definitely worthless."
 rcw_bfk.166.t:0 "German Volunteers"
 rcw_bfk.166.d:0 "The Germans will support us in our struggle for independence! Military advisers and weapons will be arriving soon, as will the German 'volunteers'!"
 rcw_bfk.166.a:0 "They will attack first."
 rcw_bfk.167.t:0 "Germany refused"
 rcw_bfk.167.d:0 "Germany Refused"
 rcw_bfk.167.a:0 "Germany refused"
 rcw_bfk.168.t:0 "First Volunteer Formations"
 rcw_bfk.168.d:0 "Finally finished writing temporary military regulations, accelerated officer courses, and establishing military schools, as well as organizing volunteers into combat-ready formations. All in all, something like 3,000 volunteers arrived - mostly former Lithuanian soldiers and officers from the RIA, as well as nationalists and members of various right-wing organizations. They are fully armed and ready to fight for freedom of Lithuania. In addition, additional reinforcements from Germany have arrived, including three Saxon volunteer regiments."
 rcw_bfk.168.a:0 "But are these heroes enough?"
 rcw_bfk.169.t:0 "General Mobilization."
 rcw_bfk.169.d:0 "It seems that national pride is still alive in Lithuania. Unfortunately, few are willing to take up arms without... Certain incentive. We need to declare a general mobilization in order to create an army and as soon as possible to put as many heroes as possible on the battlefield ready to defend the homeland."
 rcw_bfk.169.a:0 "We must."
 rcw_bfk.170.t:0 "Mobilization results"
 rcw_bfk.170.d:0 "In about two months we managed to mobilize, train, and arm about 5,000 soldiers. They lack training and sometimes enthusiasm, but, in principle, it's still a more or less combat-ready militia. In addition, we have another 5,000 reservists who are even worse trained - but more importantly, we lack weapons. In addition, there is an acute shortage of officers - 600 men are clearly not enough for effective command."
 rcw_bfk.170.a:0 "Nevertheless, we are ready to fight."
 rcw_bfk.171.t:0 "Departure of the Saxons."
 rcw_bfk.171.d:0 "There has been ferment in the Saxon volunteer regiments of late. They seem to be tired of fighting on foreign soil. Besides, even though we partly pay for their presence, the main expenses are borne by Germany, which in its economic situation is unnecessary. Berlin has therefore withdrawn most of the troops, although the brigade has remained to preserve our freedom."
 rcw_bfk.171.a:0 "Another proof that there is no German people. There would have been Prussians, not Saxons..."
 rcw_bfk.172.t:0 "The Last Wave of Mobilization"
 rcw_bfk.172.d:0 "In the intervening time we have miraculously managed to deploy two more divisions with a total of 2,000 men and another 10,000 awaiting arming and further training. However, at the moment this is our limit - we have no weapons, no officers, and no money for further militarization. Moreover, since not all recruits have joined voluntarily, unit morale is beginning to drop. We need to make peace as soon as possible!"
 rcw_bfk.172.a:0 "This reminds me of something..."
 
 rcw_bfk.201.t:0 "Initiative [FROM.GetAdjective] government."
 rcw_bfk.201.desc:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] troops were able to put up serious resistance to our armies, a number of regions were lost. Against this background, we received a peace offering."
 rcw_bfk.201.a:0 "Limitrof overestimates his forces."
 rcw_bfk.201.b:0 "Probably no forceful solution yet."
